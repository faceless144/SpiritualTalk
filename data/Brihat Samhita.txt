INTRODUCTION 



We are happy to present by the grace of God this 
edition of the Brihat Samhita of Sri Varahamihira with 
an English translation. A look at the table of contents 
will enable the reader to gauge the wonderful depth and 
wide range of the author's knowledge^In this monu- 
mental work which can rightly be called a Magnum 
Optis, there is no subject which he has not treated of 
with dignity, beauty and grandeur. This work, in fine, 
is a valuable encyclopaedia, as it deals with an astonish- 
ing variety of subjects of exceptional interest and value. 
Albiruni, the Arabian astronomer who has translated 
the ®f arc* (Laghu Jataka) of our author into Arabic, 
eulogises this £r?<?r (Samhita) for its richness in details. 
It contains important astronomical data, geographical 
details, Architecture, Sculpture, Medicine, Psychology, 
Physiology, Physiognomy, Botany, Zoology, Prosody, 
figures of speech and other subjects. This work is un- 
ique in Sanskrit Literature. The author has made it 
extremely 'interesting in spite of its dealing with technical 
subjects. y(The author is a poet of a high order. We 
can also observe here clear traces of the influence of the 
great poet Kalidasa on this author. In fact wsfflfl* 
(Varahamihira) must have been an ardent admirer of 
Kalidasa. This fact probably led people to believe that 
our author was a contemporary of the illustrious poet. 
Moreover, in the (Jyotirvidabharana), its 
author, a Kalidasa, says that he wrote it in 3068 of Kali 
Yuga or 33 b. c. and that he is a contemporary of 
Varahamihira* This work bears j internal testimony j • of 



IV 

composition at a much later date. This pseudo-Kali- 
dasa apparently wanted to pass off for the real one and 
called himself a contemporary of Varahamihira. Varaha- 
mihira's literary acknowledgment to Kalidasa will be 
apparent from the following extracts : — 

trarsfcv* gorr mxfa (Brihatsamhita LXX-23) 

(Brihatsamhita II-'2) 
fr £*rar *r **fer fat* (Brihat Samhita LXXIV-5) 
mw\ *$t srm% war n<irs*<jrw (Brihat Samhita LXXV-3) 
ste* ftftreraiar wih * ri**^a*£(Brihat Samhita LXXV-4) 
and verses 7 and 8 (The whole chapter is excellent) 
*rt if ^ fft^orq^fi (Brihat Samhita LXXVI 11-14) 
The verses i and 2 in Adhyaya LXXIV. 

All these lead us to believe in the author's admira- 
tion for Kalidasa. The metres employed by him point 
to his mastery of poetics and command of language. 
He gives various kinds of W* (Dandaka) and airor 
(Aryas).) 

**\The author is a staunch adherent of scientific princi- 
ples m Astrology, Out of respect for the ancient sages 
or masters of this science, he quotes their views and then 
states his own confirmed decisions in unmistakable terms 
(vide lll-l, 2,V-L17, and IX-6). He belongs to the 
group of first-rank scholars in scientific astronomy such 
as sfffto* (Aryabhata) £ *sr3tf (Brahmagupta) and *nw 
(Bhaskara). [The last two are posterior to him]. Varaha- 
mihira does not claim to be a pioneer in the field of 
Samhita, Before him, Parasara, Garga and others had 



written Samhitas, He refers to them and sometimes 
quotes them and gives his views in addition, for the 
benefit of mankind (vide 1-5). The wratm (Tarasara 
Tantra) is partly in prose and partly in verse of *3g* 
(Anushtub) and srrsr (Arya) type- The geographical 
details given in Chapter XIV are taken with slight 
changes from this **? (Tantra). So, it can be said to 
be the geography of India at the time of Parasara. 
According to tradition, it was Varahamihira that fixed 
' the sphere at the beginning of Aswini (Cf. Ill- 1 ). 

His style, though at times archaic, is simple, grace- 
ful and pithy, bearing the stamp of individuality and 
affinity to §£3 (Susruta) and Kalidasa. That is the 
reason why he was ranked among the nine gems of the 
Court of Vikrama. ) 

\ , '" The author was the son of wt&ffiSL (Adityadasa) 
of Ujjain (f, m. XXVI 1 1-9). The Astronomers of Ujjain 
have held that w* (Varaha) belonged to the 427th year 
of Saka era or 505 a« d. This date is confirmed by Albi- 
runi also as that of the composition of his <n3w?u%i$r 
(Pancha Siddhantika). But Dr. Bhau Daji declares 
that wt (Varaha) died in 587 A. d. Hence it should 
be concluded that 505 a. d. is the date of his birth and 
not of his composition. Scholars hold that **rf (Varaha) 
quotes 3rr4*2 (Aryabhata) who was born in 476 A. d. 
This also points to the above conclusion regarding the 
date of his birth.^^Vbout the statement made in the 
rfrft ff3raw (Jyotirvidabharana) we can only say that 
it was not written by Kalidasa, the author of Raghu- 
. vamsa, etc. Probably there were many Kalidasas and 
one such was the one belonging to the 6th century A. p. 



VI 

For, the Slower?** (Satrunjayamahatmya) mentions 
a king frEmr^si (Vikramaditya) as having ascended the 
throne in M4 A. d- Probably w$ (Varaha) and this 
neo Kalidasa were contemporaries of this Vikrama. 
Similarly ara?f«r? (Amarasimha) who is identified with 
*wfa (Amaradeva) that built the Buddha Gaya temple 
in about 500 a. D. is said to be a contemporary of our 
author- This too will lead to the above conclusion of 
his date. Many scholars from the days of Colebrook, 
Davis, Sir William Jones, Weber and Lassen have done 
much research work on Varahamihir^- 

\Accotding te Sage Garga, the Science of Astronomy- 
cum-Astrology was created by the creator himself for the 
sake of the twice-born as ancillary to the Vedas. It was 
handed down to Garga by Brahman, and from him, 
other sages got it and thus its knowledge was dissem- 
nated throughout the world ) 

It is but right that we draw here the attention of 
the readers to the erroneous judgment of many a wes- 
tern orientalist regarding Astrology and Greek influence. 
On the other hand, At is the Greeks who freely borrowed 
or learnt the various scientific truths from the Aryans of* 
India. Clement of Alexandria calls Pythagoras, the 
celebrated Greek, a pupil of the Brahmanas. The 
Swami Vivekananda,J;hc great spiritual and intellectual 
giant of modern India, has ably refuted the false theories 
of the Western Orientalists. He says : — 

There may be, it is true some similarity between the 
Greek and Indian terms in astronomy and so forth, but the 
westerners have ignored the direct Sanskrit etymology and . 
• sought for some far-fetched etymology from the Greek, That 



Vll 

such shallow and biased learning has been manifested by 
many orientalists in the West is deplorable. From a single 
Sanskrit Sloka that reads, * The Yavanas are Mlechchas; 
in them, this Science is established ; therefore, even they 

deserve worship like Rishis ' in the west, they have 

gone so far as to declare that all Indian sciences are but 
echoes of the Greek ; whereas a true reading of the Sloka 
may show that the Mlechcha disciples of the Aryan-; are 
herein praised in order to encourage them to a further study 
of the Aryan Sciences ". 

Only a sage can comprehened this Science, says 
our author (1 1-4). The present author does pay homage 
to the ancient authorities on this subject. He also just 
alludes to the various theories regarding creation pro- 
pounded by the Sankhyas, Vaiseshikas, Meemamsakas 
and others and passes on to the subject on hand \ The 
Science consists of three Skandhas or branches, viz. 
Ganita, Hora and Sakha (vide 1-9). The treatment of 
the whole subject in all its details is said to be stff^r 
(Samhita) which itself means a collection. Accordingly 
Garga says that the Great Brahman who is well-versed 
in these three branches is said to be an expert in Sam- 
hita, But our author points out that he has already done 
justice to two of the branches, viz. , Ganita (mm) and 
Jataka (&m*) in his *wfrtr£a%T (Panchasiddhantika) and 
tssricr* (Brihat Jataka) respectivety (vide 1-10). He 
gives in the 2nd Chapter the details of the *u<£<ir (Sam. 
hita) thereby indicating that the term Samhita is inde- 
pendently used for the Sakha also by itself. But he 
gives a resume of the first two Skandhas also. 

^It has been stated (CVII-13) that this work consists 
of 100 Adhyayap, in Slokas 3900 when converted into 



vm 



*3|^(Anushttib) metre.) Out of the 107 Adhyayas now 
printed in this book, the chapters on (1) wrou, (2) *^r- 
&V*i, (3) swfaw, (4) ftsroim, (5) fa^TSTC^ (6) *r$rs 
wra^ and (7) OT^rg^qofr are apparently not his. These 
have been noted in their respective places. 

The qualifications of an astrologer (Adh. II) are 
really very high and not within easy reach of ordinary 
mortals. The author says that a king should employ 
a chief astrologer assisted by 4 others. He is of opinion 
that no good people should live in a country where there 
are no good astrologers. The esteem in which the 
author holds them is indeed very great. He is equally 
strong in condemning pseudo-astrologers. 

The chapters on Omens give a great deal of useful 
information. If man is careful in noting them when he 
goes out, he will be forewarned about the results of his 
efforts. The author says that (XLVI-2) the evil omens 
are the results of man's Karma in previous births and 
that they are intended to warn him. 

There is a whole chapter giving various types of the 
aero? (Arya) metre containing their Ganas and Yatis and 
also many varieties of Dandakas. Verse (LXVIII-112) 
is an example of good poetry. 

The verse srm^srrg g*w is very useful in finding the 
time that has elapsed since the reign of the Panda vas. 
But here there is a doubt in the next line of the verse, 
where* he says so many years intervene between Yudhi- 
shtira and the commencement of the Saka era. Some hold 
different views regarding this w>. Some say that it 



refers to the fesusi* and others to the swWfircre. But 
in our opinion, it points to the latter. 

The chapter entitled T%srrs<T235 was composed by one 
ftrararaft. ?^r*te forms part of the *?gm$3r. Manu is 
said to be one of the 18 ancient authors of Samhita. 
In insfear itself, Manu's authority is recognised* This 
shows that Manu was a very ancient sage. 

The author quotes a number of authorities in this 
Science : Parasara, Garga, Vriddha Garga, Kasyapa, 
Narada, Pitamaha Siddhanta, Saura Siddhanta, Paulisa 
Siddhanta, Vasishta Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, 
Vishnugupta, Asita, Devala, Rishiputra, Sukra (Bhrigu or 
Usanas), Maya, Brihaspati, Saka, Garutman, Saptarshi, 
Badarayana, Nagnajit, Saraswata, Savitra (a work), 
Shashtyabda (a work ?), Manu, Viswakarman, Vajra, Sri 
Dravyavardhana, Bharadwaja. Kapila and Kanabhuk. 
In other works of his, the author quotes the f olio win <* : 
Satyacharya or Bhadatta, Manittha, Devaswamin, Sid- 
dhasena, Yavanacharya, Jeevasarman, Latacharya, Sim- 
hacharya; and Aryabhata. 

Some hold the view that G^rga and Vriddha Garga 
are one and the same person. But in XIII— 2 and 
XLVIII-2, he mentions Vriddha Garga by name. The 
quotations of Bhattopala, the commentator, also prove 
that they are different persons. C/. XXXI. Vriddha 
Garga is referred to in the Mahabharata also. We are 
of opinion that they are different. The wtafarr which is 
otherwise known as wrnffa contains almost t.he same 
chapters with the same titles. In this work, there js a 
chapter entitled grjcnu dealing with the Yugas. Asita 

R 



who was a great astronomer cast the horoscope of the 
Buddha according* to Hieuntsang. Kasyapa also was a 
very ancient sage, who does not mention the Romakas 
at all. 

From this work, it appears quite clear that W£ 
had already written his qv&friwr and the fisrra* (I- 1 0) 
According to him, the ?>r (Hora) should treat of horo- 
scopy, questions about journey and marriage. The <*^- 
mff£i&r which is based on t!i2 five Sidlhantts has bseti 
. published with an English translation by G- Thibut in 
1383 He seems to have written two other big works, 
namely Brihat Yatra and Brihat Vivahapatala. He Ins 
also written three smaller editions of these, viz (3f ?) 
«rc?3na«, s*f ?r?rr and ^fosr^s. The Brihat Jataka 
is very famous. Bhattopila has commented up)n it. 
One **?** also seems to have written a commentary on 
it. Albiruni speaks of a commentary on it by arsw? 
(Balabhadra). This Balabhadra has written an inde- 
pendent astrological work from which extracts are 
quoted in the pages of Jatakaparijata. The $$arj* which 
is also commented upon by Bhattotpala has been trans- 
lated into Arabic by Albiruni as already stated above. 
Only two chapters of this «f ars* are now available. The 
*iww according to Utpala cantains 14 chapters. Dr. Kern 
has said that a manuscript copy of this work was with 
him. The copy now available has only 7 chapters and 
goes under the name of *torr*r. It is not complete eitfter*' 
Hence we may conclude that it might be the •J*wr; 

We "know nothing) about the author's ftwiMM. Owing 
to its utter .absence, the commentator )ias probably in* 



troduced a chapter by fawwrcfi*. The author has writ- 
ten a srangrarr?3f which is known to us only from the 
quotations of the learned commentator. 

The author's son insist (Prithuyasas) was also a 
great astrologer- He has written the to^whjw and 
(hrrarc as far as we know. The latter is a very 
useful work giving many new ideas and has been utilised 
by Mantreswara in his Phaladeepika especially in respect 
of Ashtaka Varga (vide page 265 of that work). 

The present work has the commentary of Bhattot- 
pala which is very exhaustive and helpful. It gives 
valuable quotations from many ancient authorities and 
the other works of the author. At the end of his com- 
mentary on the Brihat Jataka, he says that he finished 
his commentary on Thursday, the 5th day of the Bright 
half of the month of Chaitra in 888 of the Saka era-956 
A. D. He has commented upon the snroren and also the 
^rarrW of 2f$3lS[. His scholarship was deep and 
vast. He seems to have written a work ^S'cTOSHrarerqi 
in 75 stanzas. He has also written a work-^flEJiiw (see 
P. 439). He was well acquainted with all the ancient 
works on Astrology, Astronomy, Poetics, etc He is 
very frank. Where he is ignorant, he openly owns that. 
For example, in perfumery, he sayg his knowledge is very 
meagre. He holds our author in the highest esteem* 
Scholars all over the world should be grateful to this 
commentator for his having preserved by his quotations 

* According to one tradition, this is Varahamihira,. himself 
as he was living in the Vindhyas before he went to the Royal 
Court, 



Xll 

many authors in this field whose works are now lost. 
We are not pioneers in presenting an English translation 
of this great work. Before us, Dr. Kern and Chidam- 
bara Iyer have translated it. Bijt those editions are not 
available now. Moreover, they are deficient in* some 
respects. They do not also give the translation by the 
side of the text. 

We too might have nodded in certain places in 
spite of our care and scrutiny ; for, we are also human 
beings and this is a very big work whose publication has 
necessarily extended over a long period. We have given 
notes under the translation wherever necessary and not 
grouped the notes in an appendix to avoid* the reader 
being put to inconvenience by referring to the concerned 
pages- 

The author says at the end of the work, the course 
of the work and the Slokas it contains. Here Sloka 
means a 8**1 or 32 syllables. 

It may not be out of place here if we tell the readers 
that in spite of the heavy cost of printing and paper> the 
price of this book has been kept sufficiently low in order 
to enable all classes of readers to have easy access to it. 
We take this opportunity to record our heartfelt thank- 
fulness to Mr. V. B. Srikantaiya, Proprietor, Messrs. 
V. B. Soobiah & Sons* Printers, for printing this huge 
work promptly in a spirit of cordial co-operation and 
service to the Goddess of Learning, in spite of the 
scarcity of labour and consequent hardships.

3nn% si*ra: TOftftqron spiral *w* I 

Sfo&a 2. — The Sun who is the procreator of the 
Universe, who is the supreme being (soul of the 
Universe), who is the natural ornament of the sky and 
who is adorned with rows of thousands of rays that 
resemble molten gold, is flourishing supreme. 

ShJca 2. — Being convinced of the correctness and 
truth of the voluminous science expounded by Brahma 
(the first sage), I now begin to write this scientific work 
explaining clearly its ideas in a way which is neither 
too brief, nor too copious. 

SloJca3. — Simply because this ancient work was 
composed by a sage, it should be good, while that written 
by an ordinary man of the present day could not be so. 
When the sense conveyed in both the cases is the same, 
while the words used alone are different, why should 



tptffctram [Adh. I. SI . 4-5 



there be any distinction between the two as it is a 
non-Vedic subject ? 

The translation of a Vedic passage into any language is not 
as sanctified as the original though the sense may be the same 
as the former lacks the ^r s ^r (Sabda) or the sound of the original- 

Sloka 4. — It has been dechred by our grand father 
(Sage Brahma) that the day of the week belonging to 
Mars — that is Tuesday — is not auspicious. People of our 
generation have also stated that the week day of Mars 
will not prove good (for beginning or doing any function). 
Wherein is the special merit in the two declarations 
of man and God ? 

Sloka 5* — Looking into the vastness of the science 
that has emanated from Brahma and others and its 
being epitomised gradually by successive sages, I also 
take pleasure in writing this work in a brief manner. 

This science viz., Astronomy-cum-Astrology was created 
by Brahman himself as ancillary to the Vedas. It was handed 
down from him to W (Garga) and other sages. 



Adh. I. SI. 6-7] JKmtewro: 



SloJca 6. — Originally, there was only darkness 
pervading throughout the universe. Then came water; 
From it sprang a blazing golden egg consisting of the 
two parts of the shell, viz., the earth and the firm ament. 
Out of this, it is said, arose Brahman, the creator, with 
the Sun and the Moon for his eyes.

Sloha 7. — Sage Kapila has declared srera-Pradhana 
(the junmanifested Prakriti) to be the material cause of 
the universe, while Sage Kanada — who was the founder 
of the atomic theory relating to the origin erf the 
Universe — has described the Dravyas — the nine sub- 
stances — as the material cause. Some have opined that 
time is the cause of the universe. There are others who 
say that the universe was produced and is sustained by 
the natural and necessary action of substances according 
to their inherent properties (and not by the agency of 
a supreme being). Lastly, there are people who state 
that the actions— good or bad— of the beings are the 
cause of the universe. 

8lo1ca8. — Enough of this incidental discourse on 
a polemical and vast subject, and which, if it were to 
be discussed, would swell to a very great length and 
be of no avail to us for the present. I am now 
going to treat in a decisive manner of the principles of 
the science of Astrology — Jyotissastra — and the ancillary 
topics- 

SlpJca 9. — The science of Astrology consists of 
various branches and is in three sections or Skandhas — 
viz., nfSrar-Ganita, ffar-Hora and ww-Sakha, and the 
treatment of the subject in its entirety is termed by sages 



Adh. LSI 10,11] iw&sswr: 



ftffcm-Samhita (compilation or collection). The first 
W* or section where the exact movements, etc., of 
the planets in the several signs of the zodiac are ascer- 
tained through mathematical computation is otherwise 
known as tf^-Tantra. Horoscopy is another section ; 
*wfirft«ra-Angavinischaya or locating precisely the cor- 
rect position of the Lagna, etc. , which is the first step in 
w<f$w-Jatakakarma is the 3rd.

Sloka 10. — By me have been treated in detail in 

the whip* (Karana Grantha) TOfa^FcHsr (Pancha 

Siddhanthika), of retrograde and direct motions of the 

several (non-luminous) planets from Mars onwards, their 

disappearance (eclipse) through proximity to the Sun, 

and their reappearance or emerging after conjunction 

with the Sun, their state of being at war or planetary 

fight. All things connected with horoscopy along with 

births, journeys, marriages, etc., have been already 

treated of in my previous works. 

This shows that Varahamihira had already written Brihat 
Jataka, Yatra, etc.

SloJca 11. — Omitting queries and their respective 
answers which are not highly useful for our purpose, 
and also the origin of the planets and other unessential 
discussions, I am going to treat of real facts — the quint- 
essence of everything that is useful. —

ufa^uti^TWtFK I IRII The Astrologer. 

We shall now comment upon the aphorisms relating 
to an astrologer : — 

2« The astrologer should be of noble descent, 
good-looking, modest in disposition, truthful, free from 
malice, impartial, with well-proportioned limbs all perfect 
and unimpaired, strong joints, undeformed, with fine 
hands, feet, nails* eyes, chin, teeth, ears, forehead, 
eye-brows and head, with handsome physique and 
a voice deep and sonorous. For, merits and demerits 
are generally the reflections of good and bad physical 
features.*

a*r ft ir ^sw?^ a^^nff^^rat *ra^ u 

* 3. The following are the good qualities of an • 
astrologer. He must be clean and active, bold and ' 



Adh. II. 4] ftrtQsmm: 7 

eloquent, have readiness of wit, fully conversant with 
the details of the place and time and sincere in dispo- 
sition. He should not be timid in an assembly, should 
not be overpowered by his fellow students, must be well, 
trained, should understand the heart of others, should 
be free from vices, must be conversant with the art 
of propitiation, with hygiene, magic and ablutions, 
should be engaged in the worship of the Devas, 
should be an observer of fast and penance, should 
be endowed with great power resulting from the 
wonderful achievements of his scientific knowledge, 
should be capable oi answering questions put by others, 
and voluntarily suggesting palliatives and remedies 
regarding things other than the visitations of God, 
He should also be thoroughly conversant with works 
dealing with calculations of the positions, etc., of planets, 
Samhita, Horoscopy and their several details. 

wrf6|arw«w«nft«« *Erara %m ^ to I 

4. In that astronomical science, there are five 
schools, viz., Paulisa (belonging to Pulisa), Romaka (a 
Siddhanta, probably derived from the Romans), Vasishtha 
(belonging to Vasishta), Saura (belonging to Surya), 
Paitamaha (or Brahma Siddhanta), that is Siddhanta by 
Brahmagupta. In these are treated of all about Yuga, 
year, Ayana, Ritu, Masa, Paksha (fortnight), Day # , Night, 
Yama, Muhurtha, Nadee, Prana, Thruti and its further 
subdivisions of time> and the astrologer should be con- 
versant with all these and also with the ecliptic. 



8 i t ^ i !|«Him [Adh. II. 5-7 

5. He should also be familiar with the four kinds 
of measurements of time, viz., ^fa-solar ; sre*, a duration 
(day) intervening between the first rising of any 
particular planet or star and its corresponding next 
rising ; irinsr stellar calculation in terms of lunar months, 
Tithis, etc., with the occurrence of Adhimasa or inter- 
calary lunations and intercalary days. 

A WZ day is the interval between one sun-rise and the 
succeeding one. A mff* or terrestrial day is the interval between 
two contiguous risings of the Sun at the Equator. v Thirty such 
days constitute a BJtt month, ^r^ri^T is the time taken by the 
Moon to clear a Star, A ^^rtf consists of 30 lunar Tithis and is 
a period intervening between two successive conjunctions of the 
Moon with the Sun. An Adhika Masa is a period. of a lunar 
month occurring between two solar Sankramanas in the same 
Rasi. For this and st^T, see Suryasiddhanta. 

6. He should be familiar with* the computation of 
the commencement and termination times of the 60 
year-period, the Yuga (5 year-period), a year, a month, 
a day, an hour and also of their respective lords. 

There are 12 Yugas or five-year periods in a cycle of 
60 years and their lords are stated as follows : 

lOTi^awi f^ft«^«T^w«i«i^rftwrrr: af^er: u 



Adh. II. 8-10] f|<Mte«*Pi« 



In the case of the several systems of measurements 
of time, viz y . Solar, Savana, Lunar, etc, he must be 
able to distinguish what are similar and what are not 
similar ; and also be conversant with the aptness or 
otherwise of each for (being used for) any particular 
purpose. 



8 In cases of difference of opinion among the 
Siddhantas regarding the actual termination of an 
Ayana, he should be able to reconcile them by showing 
the agreement between accurate calculation and what 
has been actually observed in the circle drawn on the 
ground through shadow and water-appliances. 

9. He should also be conversant with the causes 
that lead the planets from the Sun onwards to proceed 
in different kinds of motions — rapid, slow, southerly, 
northerly, towards apojee, perijee, etc. 

Vide Sripatipaddhati— P. 48. 

10 In the matter of the Solar and Lunar eclipses, 
he should be able to predict by calculation the times 
of their commencement, cessation, direction, magnitude, 
duration, intensity and color as well as the Moon's 
prospective conjunctions with the non-luminous planets 
and their warfare. 



10 twJfiami* [Adh. II. 11-13 

11. He should in the case of every planet be 
able to calculate its distance (in Yojana) from the 
Earth, the length of its orbit, etc. 

12. He should be familiar with the Earth's 
rotation (in its own axis) round the Sun and also 
with its revolution in the stellar firmament, its shape 
(^TC2n*r) and the like, the latitude (of a place) and its 
complement, the difference in the lengths of the day 
and night, the Chara Khandas of a place, the rising 
periods of the several signs at any place, the methods of 
conversion from shadow to time and time to shadow, 
to find the exact period— elapsed ghatikas since Sun-rise 
or Sun-set — at any required time from the position of 
the Sun or from the Lagna as the case may be. 

For Charakhandas, see Sripatipaddhati PP- 157- 160- 

13. He is a true astrologer who is able to under- 
stand the objections and points of differences and meet 
them in clear and convincing language thus proving the 
truth of the science in its pristine purity in the same 
way as separating pure gold by bringing it under the 
touch-stone, fire, hammer, etc., and enabling it to retain 
its pure value. 



Adh. II. SI. 1-4] ftNtavrat 11 

SZoJa Z. — How could one who is not able to 
understand the ideas contained in the Sastras (in- 
correctly interprets the same), nor cares to answer any 
question that may be put to him, nor explains his views 
to his students, be termed an Astrologer that has grasped 
the essence of the science ? 

s farms urowr ?#tt% ^ %wrrck IRII 

SloJca 2 — He is only a fool whose interpretation 
is quite opposed to the spirit of the text and whose 
calculations are also wrong. This is just like his 
approaching his grand father or God Brahman and 
praising before him his grand mother or Saras wati attri- 
buting the qualities of a courtezan to her. 

ftafl ^ S^ *% *fefi span ii^ii 

SloJca 3. — When the astrologer has well-understood 
the mathematical portion, and has arrived at the correct 
Lagna by means of shadow, water-appliances, etc.t 
and has acquired a firm grasp of the science his predic- 
tions and teachings will never prove void of effect. 



12 liwfwfum [Adh. II. 14 

The revered Vishnugupta says : 

SloJca 4. — It may be possible for a man trying to 
cross the ocean even to reach the other shore through 
the force of the wind. But it is not at all possible for 
a person who is not a sage to reach even mentally 
the other shore of the vast ocean of Kalapurusha, i. e. } 
Astrology. 

14. And the science of horoscopy comprises the 
following : the several divisions, viz., Rasi, Hora, Drek- 
kana, Navamsa* Dwadasamsa, Trimsamsa, the ascertain- 
ment of their strength or weakness, the calculation of the 
Balas of the planets due to f^ wre, ^ra, and %2r in 
their various (Vargas) divisions, the humours of the 
planets, the constituent elements of the body represented 
by them, the substances pertaining to them, their castes, 
their characteristics, etc., the time of Nisheka (impreg- 
nation) and actual birth, extraordinary cases of birth 
and their prediction, the time of one's immediate death, 
the years contributed by ike planets for one's life, the 
Dasa and its sub-divisions, Ashtakavarga, Raja yogas, 
the Chandra or lunar yogas, conjunctions of two or 
more planets, Nabhasa and other yogas and their effects, 
the effects of planets due to their occupation of 



Adh. II. 15] ftrfhrrs^mi 13 

a Rasi, Bhava, etc., and the effects of their aspects on 
them, one's exit from the world, the region to which 
the deceased had belonged in his previous birth and 
the region to which he goes, the effects on queries — 
good or bad — at any time, good or bad omens, the 
performance of marriage and other rituals. 

All the above subjects are treated of in Brihat Jataka and 
Vivaha Patala— f*RTf<T2Ttf. This latter work is not by Varaha- 
mihira bufc by one author called fWrerHT, another great astro- 
loger, who has writben on Muhurta for marriage and so on. [See 
Adhyaya 103 infra] 

%eif^w^ 

15. And in the work *rrar too, the seers have declared 
all about Tithis, week days, Karanas, asterisms, Muhurta 
(48'), Lagna, Yoga, the throbbing of the body, dreams, 
baths for success in battle, sacrifices performed for the 
propitiation of planets, the worship of the Yakshas 
7 days prior to the day of starting on a journey, prognosis 
through the movement— clockwise or otherwise — of the 
flame of the Sacrificial fire, the correct understanding 
of the feelings of the elephants and horses through the 
movements of their limbs, military proclamations and 
tendencies, omens, etc., the suitability through the help 
of the planets of any of the six expedients in foreign 
politics, viz,, (1) srrN-peace or alliance (2) rlwt-war 
(3) ^re-march or expedition (4) wi*r or WOT-halt (5) 
wars-seeking shelter and (6) 1f*-duplicity ; the four 



14 l^saniT^ [Adh. II. SI. 5. 16-18 

means of success against an enemy, vis., (1) srr^w-conci- 
liation or negotiation (2) ^-bribery (3) ^sowing dis- 
sensions and (4) ^'punishment (open attack)— to be 
judged by the omens (good or bad) when setting out 
on a journey ; nature of the camping ground — lands 
for the location of the army — , the colors of (ceremonial) 
fires, the procedure of employing at the proper time 
ministers, spies, envoys, foresters, instructions for besieg- 
ing and capture of fortresses belonging to others.

Sloha 5. — He who has got a clear grasp of the 
astrological science inclusive of the mathematical portion 
as if it were spread before his eyes in the world and 
engraved in his intellect and imbedded in his heart, the 
predictions made by him will never prove ineffective.

inclusive of the King and the ordinary individual. And 
all the above should be divined by an astrologer every 
moment with a single-minded devotion. And it is not 
possible for a single person to comprehend all these 
occurring day and night. Hence an astrologer in the 
employ of a king should engage four efficient assistants 
for the task, each to be in charge of two directions, thus : 
one to observe east, and south-east, a second for the 
south and south-west, a third for the west and north-west, 
and the fourth for the north and north-east. By this, it 
will be possible for noting clearly the fall of meteors and 
the like which is sudden in its nature and one's good and 
bad effects have to be predicted through the form, color, 
viscidity, size, etc., of these falling bodies and as to how 
they dash or strike against the other planets and stars.

Shlca 1. — The Sun's southern course began at one 

time from the latter half of Aslesha and the northern, 

from the beginning of Dhanishta. This must indeed have 

; been the case as it is so recorded in our ancient Sastras.

SloJcas 2-3. — At present, one course of the Sun begins 
from the commencement of Karkataka and the other from 
the beginning of Makara. That it is different from what 
has been stated above can easily be ascertained by direct 
observation. 

By marking every day the position of an object situ- 
ated at a distance at the time of the rising or setting of 
the Sun, or watching the entry and exit of the brim of 
the shadow of a stick placed at the centre of a big circle 
drawn on the Earth, the difference in the Sun's course 
may be detected. 

3rjn<*j ihwhK ftftrft f for mti wnn i 

SloJca 4. — When the Sun retraces his steps before he 
has reached Makara and changes his direction, he destroys 
the West and the South. When he similarly changes his 
course without reaching Karkataka, he brings evil to the 
North and the East.

Sloh% 5. — When the Sun changes his course after 
staying a little longer in his northern course, there will be 
prosperity all over and increase of crops. The same result 
will accrue when he is in his natural course. But if there 
should be any change or alteration in his gait, he will 
cause fear to the whole mankind. 

STfffi is interpreted by Bhattotpala as agreement between cal- 
culation and actual observation in the Sun's change of course. 

Sloka 6.— On days other than Parva ( = the 8th, 14th 
of each half lunar month and the days of the full and 
New Moon), the planet srer — Thwashta trims off a part of

through weapons, fire and famine.

SloJca 7. — There are 33 Ketus, the sons of Rahu, and 
are named Thamasa Keelakas. When they appear in the 
Sun's disc, their effects should be predicted according to 
their colour, position and form. 

SloJca 8. — And these Thamasakeelakas when they 
enter the Sun's disc produce malefic effects. The effects 
will be auspicious when they enter the Moon's orb. When 
they assume the forms of a crow, a truncated body, a 
sword, etc,, they produce inauspicious effects even in the 
Moon's disc. Much worse will be the effect they produce 
when they are in the Sun's disc. 

ShJcas 9-10. — When they become visible, the follow- 
ing indications appear : the water will become muddy 
and foul ; the sky will be filled with dust ; there will 
arise storms carrying sand with them and crushing tops of 
mountains and trees ; the trees and creepers will reveal 
effects contrary to the seasons ; the animals and birds 
will become heated by the Sun ; there will be false fires

Slokas 12-16. — Wherever these Thamasa Keelakas 
show themselves in the Sun's disc, there will be distress 
and misery to the kings ruling over these countries. And 
even sages, emaciated being stricken with hunger, for- 
saking their usual religious duties and*good conduct will be 
emigrating with great difficulty to other countries, having 
in their arms infants — mere skeletons — without flesh due 
to want of food. Good men will be robbed of their entire 
wealth by thieves and will be heaving long sighs ; and 
their eye-1ids will be drooping and bodies, languid ; and 
their eyes will be obstructed by tears due to qprrow. 
Feeling weak and disgusted on account of trouble caused

diseases ; if the form be that of a crow, there will be 
danger from thieves, and if the form be that of a Keelaka 
(wedge), there will be famine. 

SloTca 18.— If the Sun's disc be obscured by 
obstacles in the form of a king's paraphernalia such as

Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras is indicated.

Sun's disc bring danger from these directions to the 
people that behold them. People will get troubles from

appearance on the Sun's disc. 

Slohas 21-22. — If the Sun be with upward rays of 
copper (red) colour, it denotes the ruin of the commander. 
If the colour be yellow, it betokens the destruction of the 
king's son ; if it be white, the preceptor will die. If the 
colour of the Sun's upward rays be variegated or misty 
and if there should be no immediate rain following, it 
causes chaos and disaster to the country through thieves, 
clash of weapons, etc.

Shha 1. — A demon's head, though cut off for his 
having devoured nectar, is still not deprived of life, it is 
said, as a result of the potency of nectar and that head 
became a planet, so declare some sages. 

Sloka 2.— His disc is similar in form to those of 
the Sun and the Moon, but he is not visible in the 
heavens except on Parva days (New and . Full Moon 
days) on account of his blackness in colour. Owing to 



Adh. V. SI. 31 ra*fts^r*r: 45 

a boon conferred by Brahma, he is visible only at the 
time of eclipses and not on other days. 

Simhika begged of Sage Kasyapa at an unseasonal hour 
for progeny . Enraged at this untimely request,' he gave her 
a son who was dreadful like Yama. This son came to be called 
Rahu. As soon as he was born, he fought and sustained a 
defeat at the hands of the son of Aditi. Humiliated by this, 
he performed severe penance for 10,000 divine years on the 
summit of the Himalayas. He asked God Brahma to confer 
on him the status of a planet, immortality, victory over the 
Gods and power to devour the two luminaries. At this, the 
Lord spoke smilingly thus : " You will find it extremely hard 
to digest these two ; still, be it so. " So saying, the Lord 
vanished. Then Rahu rushed at them. Then God Vishnu 
hurled his discus, chopped his head off and said, " Let the 
creator's words however, not go to waste. In your respective 
periods you may devour the two luminaries and thereby indicate 
good and bad things for the world." 

Sloka 3. — One school of learned men says that 
Rahu — son of Simhika — is of a serpentine form with only 
the face and the tail ; while another class maintains that 
he is formless and of the nature of pure darkness.

SloJca 8. — In her own eclipse, the Moon enters the 
shadow of the Earth, and in that of the Sun, the solar 
disc. Therefore it is that the lunar eclipse does not 
commence at the western limb, nor the solar at the 
eastern limb, 

SloJca 9. — Just as the shadow of a tree goes on 
increasing on one side on account of the motion of the 
Sun, so is the case with the Earth's shadow every night 
by its hiding the Sun during its rotation. 

Sloka 10, — If the Moon, in her course towards the 
East and placed in the 7th house from the Sun, does 
not swerve much either to the north or the south, she 
enters the shadow of the earth. 

SloJca 11. — The Moon moving from the , west 
conceals the solar disc from below just like a cloud. 
The solar eclipse is therefore different in various 
countries according to the visibility of the eclipsed disc*

cealing agency is very big, while in that of the solar, it is 
small Hence in semi-lunar and semi-solar eclipses, 
the luminous horns are respectively blunt and sharp. 

Sloka 13. — Thus the cause for the eclipses has 
been given by our ancient masters possessed of divine 
sight. Hence, the scientific truth is that Rahu is not 
at all the cause of that.*

ferred by Brahman on Rahu. the Demon : "You shall 
have to live and rest satisfied with whatever gifts and 
oblations that may be given at the time of an 
eclipse. " During that period his presence is recognised. 
There are two places or nodes for the Moon caused by 
her deviation south or north and this is ascertained by 
astronomical calculation. The ascending node is termed 
Rahu.

tained through symptoms in the form of portents. For, 
these latter, viz*, fall of meteors, etc., occur at other 
times also. 

Shka l7s-~ It is uot correct to say that an eclipse 
cannot occur unless five planets combine; it is also

The direction in which the eclipse commences has to be 
found out through the deflection and angles of the Moon 
known as *r*H*3R and srsnra* (Ayanavalana and Aksha-

out by noting the exact time of conjunction of the Sun

consequence. If the lunar eclipse commences from the 
southeast, it is called Savya, while, from the north-east, 
it is called Apasavya. In the case of the solar eclipse, 
the respective directions are northwest and southwest.

break of epidemics. And when Rahu is like the Patala 
flower in colour, there will be risk from lightning and 
thunder-bolts. If the colour be a mixture of red and 
brown, it indicates the ruin of the Kshatriyas and the

the Moon occupied fche same sign as at the eclipse, should perform 
expiatory ceremonies in order to ward off any calamities that 
may befall them or their families. These are explained in detail 
in Adhyaya 67 of the ^c^TjU^-Mathsya Purana. They generally

divide the result by 3750. To the quotient thus obtained, 
add the Saka years. Divide this by 60 and the remain- 
der thereof by 5. The quotient represents the five-year-

denotes the number of years that have elapsed in the

product (in the first case) and the quotient (in the second 
case). Divide the resuit by 4. The quotient will reveal 
the particular asterism reckoned from Dhanishta. The 
remainder will denote the Padas (<m0 in the next star 
that have been traversed by Jupiter. 

In a Mahayuga (the period comprising the four Yugas), 
the number of solar years is 4320000=3750 X 1152 * 4370640 

That of Jupiter for the same period is as per Surya 

4370688* =3794 x 1152 Siddhanta. 



96 wtffcaron [Adh. VIII. SI. 22 



So that for every 3750 solar years we have 3794 years of Jupiter. 

44 
Therefore 1 solar year = l+ryr-i years of Jupiter. 

To find out the number of Jupiter years that had elapsed (in 
Kaliyuga) at the time of the commencement of the Salivahana era, 
we have to proceed thus : 

The number of solar years that have passed from the beginning 
of Kaliyuga till the commencement of the Saka era is 3179. This 

converted into Jupiter years will be ~tt; X 3179 or 3216 rz-r-^ 

O/50 37jU 

Now it is known that Kaliyuga commenced in the year Vijaya 
(the 27th year from Prabhava, which is the first year in a cycle of 
60 years of Jupiter). 

Therefore, 3216 j^j + 26 or 3242 l ~ beta* divided by 60, 

the remainder will give the particular year of Jupiter (in his cycle of 
60 years) from Prabhava at the time of commencement of the Saka 

1 1 0F\ 
era, and this remainder is 2 T^hi which is the 3rd year or the year 

Sukla of the cycle. 

Coming down to the period subsequent to the commencement of 
the Saka era, say the present time fcwTR 3^-Vartamana Saka 
1868 April 1945), the number of Jupiter years that have elapsed 

will be 1867 4 -- 4- 2 - " from the beginning of Prabhava 

3398 \V>6 774 

or 1867 + 21 °~? + 2 "-" or 1891 '' ^ which indicates that it 

is the 32nd year of the cycle or Vilambi. But actually, it is 
Hemalamba. The reason is that the figures for Jupiter's years as 
given by Aryabhatta or as per Surya-siddhanta are a bit more than 
that of Varahamihira. His figure 8589 appearing in Sloka 20 is 
different from 8626 that we got above. Calculating backwards 
from 8589, we find the number of siderial revolutions of Jupiter 
according to Varahamihira to be 364190000. This is probably the* 
correct figure. 

Sloka 22 gives a clue to find out the particular lunar mansion 
in which Jupiter may happen to be at any given time. 



Adh. VIII. Si. 23-24] *e*rwn* 97 

Taking the current Saka year 186 8, we have the Saka years that 

have elapsed as 1867. The number of Jupiter years that have elapsed 

as calculated in the penultimate paragraph"of page 96 will be 

774 
1891 rz— This when divided by 60 gives a quotient 31. 

As per Sloka 22, we have to multiply the above quotient 31 by 

9 ; then we get 279 ; and by dividing the same quotient by 12 

7. 7 

we get 2"T* Adding these two figures we get 281—. Dividing 

this result by 4 we get 70 and odd, thus indicating the asterism 
traversed by Jupiter, as the l?th. This when reckoned from 
Dhanishta is Uttaraphalguni.

a still more accurate knowledge of the real latitude of Regulus

Asita, Devala and many others, I expound the same in 
the most unambiguous manner.

the rising or setting of Ketu, inasmuch as there are three 
sorts of Ketus, viz., celestial, atmospheric and terrestrial. 

SloJca 3. — In places where, though there is no fire, 
there is still an igneous appearance, Ketu's presence is 
recognised except where there are glow-worms, phos- 
phoric lights on graves, gems, jewels and the like. 

SloJca 4. — The atmospheric Ketus are such as are 
seen on flagstaffs, weapons, bouses, trees, horses, ele- 
phants and the like ; the celestial ones are those that 
are seen among the asterisks. Such as do not belong 
to the above two categories are to be known as terrestrial 
Ketus.

particular direction thereof), position (in which part of the 
firmament vis-a-vis planets and asterisms), contact, the 
act of covering the neighbouring celestial body with a 
smoky mantle and colour. 

Sloha 7.— The effects of Ketu will last for as many 
months as the number of days during which it is visible. 
In the same way the number of years can be guessed 
from the number of months during which it is visible, 
the effect in all cases commencing after the first three 
fortnights of its appearance.

NOTE. — Compare (with the above) what modem science has to 
say on the subject of comets : 

"What then is a comet according to the latest scientific 
researches ? The spectroscope has pretty well solved the query. 
It consists, first, of a more or less solid nucleus of fire, blazing and 
glowing ; second, of vasfe masses of incandescent gas, constituting 
the luminous head; third, solid materials, consenting the tail, whick 
are ponderable, which reflect the Sun's light and are carried along 
by the influence of the nucleus ; fourth, an immense prolongation 
of the tail in the nature of attenuated volumes of gas. The solid 
materials of a comat, it is believed, consist of stones and sand, 
particles ground by ceaseless attrition, The proof of. this is the 
concession of most astronomers that meteoric showers are shreds 
and patches of cometic matter* dropped irom the tail, and these 
meteors are stones. The genesis of comets is found to be in the 
explosion of planetary bodies, a theory not without good scientific 
authority. 

Arago estimates that there lare 17,000,000 'of these fiery wan- 
derers within the orbit of Neptune, and Lambert regarefcs 
500,000,000 as a moderate estimate for those in the solar system. 
All the astronomers agre* that they are scattered through space as 
profusely as the fish in the seas. The Orbit of the Earth is over- 
whelmed in a fine net work of cometary orbits, and our globe is 
like a lost child in a forest full of wfld beasts. "

Slolcas 2—7. — Listen ! ye, now, to the description of 
the appearance of the Sage, who, in days of yore, sud- 
denly heightened the splendour of the ocean by the dry- 
ing up of its waters through the mountains situated in the 
interior whose summits were scooped out by the claws of 
crocodiles and which had streams of water in the form 
of choice gems and jewels falling upon them along with 
pearls, putting to shame as it were the Gods having a 
limited number of gems on their diadems, 

He, by whom the ocean though deprived of its 
watery contents, was made more beautiful by means of 
the mountains shorn of their trees and deckel with gems, 
jewels and corals and through the serpents that emerged 
from them in long rows, 

He by whom the great ocean though brought to grief 
being drained off, was raised to divine glory since it 
displayed glittering whales, water-elephants nnd serpents, 
also heaps of gems scattered about,

He who converted the ocean (the lord of the rivers) 
into the sky, as it had white clouds in the form of whales, 
stars in the form of gems, the Moon in the form of 
crystal gem, the autumnal lustre in the form of the water- 
less bed and Ketus or comets in the form of the rays of 
the gems on the hoods of serpents, 

And he who stemmed the Vindhya Mountain which 
was bent upon obstructing the course of the Sun's car- 
riage and so had moving peaks, and which was adorned 
by the flags hoisted aloft in the form of clothes on the 
bodies of the Vidyadharas, who clinging to the shoulders 
of their confused lovers eagerly seated them on their own 
Japs ; which possesses streams inside the caves occupied 
by lions whose heads are covered with bees following the 
fragrance caused by the tasting of the blood mixed with 
ichor on the heads of the elephants and are wearing orna- 
mental wreaths of 'Vana* flowers as it were on their 
heads ; which was scratching as it were, the firmament 
with its uplifted peaks which had the deep sound of 
humming of the swarms of the intoxicated bees that were 
scattered by the shaking of the trees in bloom by the 
elephants and which (peaks) were the abodes of hyenas* 
bears, tigers and monkeys ; which is embraced in private 
by the Rewa river (Narmada) having the Madana trees 
on her banks just as one is embraced in amorous sport by 
one's beloved, in whose gardens dwell the Gods and 
which is accompanied by sages who subsist on water, 
nothing, roots and air ; such was the Vindhya, when he 
was stemmed by Agasthya. Listen ! ye, now, to the

Stofta 3. — The Seven Sages were in the lunar man- 
sion — Magha — when King Yudhishtira was ruling over 
the ear Lb, the period of that King being 2526 years be- 
fore the commencement of the Saka (Vikramarka?) era. 

The assumption made by certain commentators that ^fc 
should invariably refer to Vikrama Saka (56 B. 0.) does not seem 
to be altogether correct. For, it ia said in the Mahabharata that 
Kali set in soon after Krishna's departure. This should be 3102 
B. C. Hence the age of Yudhishtira should be somewhere at the 
earlier part of the 32nd century before Christ. Subtracting 2526 
from this figure we find that the Saka referred to in the Sloka should 
be in the 7th Century B. C. (far earlier than the age of the Buddha 
— 5th century B. C). Hence the above remark. 

Sloka 4. — The sages in their course remain for a 
period of 100 years in each lunar mansion. Whichever 
star to the east of which the sages rise, makes them con- 
spicuous, in that they are said to be posited.

With reference to our Puranas, it an be ascertained that 
3P^OT-Jambudweepa (on© of the seven continents surrounding 
the mountain Meru) was divided into nine subcontinents each 
being termed a ^rfVarsha. These nine divisions are (l)jS-

Ilavrita (5) fft-Hari (6) 3g*ri*r-Ketumila (7) *5W- 
Bhadraswa (8) ferr-Kinnara and (9) W^-Bharata. The name 
of the Adhyaya suggests in itself tint the worl f 4-Kurnm in- 
stead of being literally translated as 'tortoise' should bs con- 
sbrued to mean 'Globe/ This is further supported by the first 
.Sloka of the chapter which stirts with nine divisions of the 27 
lunar minsions — each division consisting of 3 stars com mencing 
from Krittika. The reader will note that the original divisions 
of the zodiac started from the first quarter of Krittiki, the star 
owned by the Sun, the lord of the nine pianets. 

That our ancient authors went hand in hand with a thorough 
knowledge of the 18 Puranas is another reason for us to interpret 
fjR as Globe. For ^r^-Jayadeva, the poet, in his ifimn^- 
Gitagovinda, while describing the 10 incarnations of Vishnu as 

observes the fflfrsrcTR" as l "sm^TCcr ' (one who carries the Globe on

The following remarks of Dr. H. Kern on the subject will also 
be of interest : 

"The word Kurma is the specific Sanskrit form of a word once cpmraon 
to all Indo-European tongues, viz, Kurma, Lat. culmus, TV u ton. holm, etc. 
It does not originally denote the 'tortoise' itself, but as back, for the proper 
meaning is "mound, buckle, half-globe, holm " Even in Sanskrit, in such 
compounds as Kurmonnata, the word s<gnides the iorm o( the back of the 
tortoise. At the time when the word Kurma Vibhaga became current, Kurma 
was taken in its proper sense. Yet in Liter t*mes, they whoJlv mistook the 
meaning and made an absurd drawing, representing a tortoise, as if Kurma 
could denote a level ' The rendering by T.lobe' is nn{ wholly r\act, since 
properly only a half-globe, a holm «s supposed to be raised above the waters."

Slokan 4-5. — At the occurrence of an occultation t 
rains will fail and discord will prevail among friends and 
powerful families. When planets graze each other, there 
is danger from the sword, dissensions among royal coun- 
cillors and dearth of food. At a clashing of the rays, there 
will be war between kings and desolation by sword, 
disease and famine. At the «iw**J-Apasavya conflict, 
their will be hostile encounters between monarchs. 
• Utpala says : «itow *?%<* gr*«re i *w fnrr qftraNrtr- 

srfafa tngrov fjsnfic l (XVIII-8 infra.) 

Dr. Kern adds— "This is not difficult to understand, for the Moon leav- 
ing, in her eastward course, a planet or star at her own right (i. e. standing 
north from the planet or star), may be said to make a pradakshina ; standing 
to the southt i. e., leaving a planet or star at her left, she makes an apasavya. 
Thus Apasavya means "from the left, at the left," and, in a special appli. 
cation, "at the south side ;" but from this, it does not necessarily follow 
that apasavya originally was simply the opposite of Savya, "left ". Yet 
it cannot be doubted that they have taken apasavya as the reverse of Savya, 
or, in other words, that apa was understood to mean, not "from the side,*' 
but "not ; ' ' therefore aaavya was considered to Be simply synonymous with 
apasavya. Moreever, Savya has got the meaning of "right," precisely the 
reverse ef its most common acceptation, v%* t "left." 



Adh. XVII. SI. 6-8] qrwftswffn; 187 

Not to be confounded with this acceptation of Savya is its use in augury. 
Applied to augural birds, etc., Savya is strictly and properly "left," but as 
birds first appearing from the left of the observer move in the direction of 
his right, and keep him at their own right, 5 tvya, "left," and pradakshina, 
'moving to the right," imply the 'same, without being the same. Utpala 
remarks ; 

In astronomical works, Savya "moving (revolving) toward the right" and 
Apasavya "moving toward the left, is common enough \e. g. Surya Siddha- 
ntaxii— 55 ; Siddhanta Siromani, Goladhyaya 3—51, Arya Bhatiya IV— 1G.

Utpala has made the following remarks ;

It will thus be seen that Varahamihira fulfils the promise he 
had made above (in the Panchasiddhantika), by 'treating of this 
subject in the present work. Dr. Kern remarks in his foot notes: — 

"It is not known which source has been chiefly used by our author in 
this particular instance ; thus much, however, is certain, that long before 
his time Greek horoscopy had been introduced into India." 

By sftjttfra, Varahamihira certainly refers to Garga,Para« 
sara and a host of other Hindu astrologers [as he [has consistently 
been doing in all his works. No doubt, Yavana lived before 
Varahamihira and that Greek astrology was not unknown in India 
in his time. But to say that this idea about Varsha and Masa 
Phalas has been introduced into India by Yavana is 'certainly in- 
correct as sages who lived in India ages before have freely spoken 
about these. It may safely be said that ancient sages of India like 



196- : ni^tnnn [Adh, XIX» SI 1*3 

Garga, Parasar*, etc., have known all about these and that 
Varahamibira perfected all these things in his Samhita as promised, 
knowing also that Yavanacharya also has known all about these* 

It may not be out of place to bring to the notice of the readers . 
that Maharshi Parasara, the father of the celebrated Vyasa, popu- 
larly known as %^*n*T-Vedavyasa, existed far before the advent 
of Kali Offl%), that is, the fourth millennium B. C, and that for a 
sage of this repute, it is not correct to conclude that Parasara had 
to learn everything from 'the West. What I want to impress is 
that our ancient sages who were founders of the Six Angas (^jp) 
of the Vedas, did not require any foreign agency to put them in the 
way, but that they were in themselves, each a mine of knowledge. 
Further, to support my statement that Indian culture existed 
earlier than the Greeks, I quote below the following line from 
Raghu vamsa : — *

and the cluster of stars in the sky lose their brilliance.

out in the bright half of Sravana. Similarly, those that 
are formed in the bright half of Magha will see the 
light of the day in the dark fortnight of Sravana. The 
former part of Bhadrapada may be fixed upon as the 
time of birth corresponding to the dark half of Magha. 
Those that are formed in the first half of Phalguna may 
be said to come out in the latter half of Bhadrapada. 
But those in the dark fortnight of Phalguna will t be born 
in the bright half of Aswayuja. The clouds that are 
formed in the first half of Chaitra will yield water in 
the latter half of Aswayuja ; and those that are formed 
in the latter half of Chaitra will rain in the first half 
of Kartika.

will be favourable if they be accompanied by lightning, 
water-drops, dust-storm, and the Sun and the Moon 
screened by the clouds. If there should be beautiful 
flashes of lightning emanating from (moving towards ?) 
the auspicious quarters, an intelligent astronomer should 
predict the thriving of all crops. If on the same day 
there be rain with dust or if children engage them- 
selves in happy sports, the cries of birds be pleasant and 
their sport be in dust, water or the like, if the Sun and 
the Moon , be encircled by halos which are glossy and 
not broken, then, there will be rain tending to the growth

Sloha 4. — Some sages such as Kasypa opine that 
if there be rain in a certain area at the beginning, there 
will be good rain there throughout the season; while 
others such as Devala maintain that if there be rain over 
an area of ten Yojanas, there will be plenty of rain 
during the whole season. But, according to Garga, 
Vasishta and Parasara, good rain during the season 
should be predicted if there be rainfall over an area of 
not less than twelve Yojanas.

Chittra, Revati and Dhanishta, the quantity of rainfall 
in the season will be 16 Dronas ; in Satabhishak, Jyeshta 
and Swati, it will be 4 Dronas ; in Krittika, 10 Dronas J 
in Sravana, Magha, Anuradha, Bharani and Moola, 
14 Dronas ; in Purvaphalguni, 25 Dronas ; in Punar- 
vasu, 20 Dronas ; in Visakha and Uttarashadha, 20 
Dronas; in Asleshn, 13 Dronas. In Uttarabhadra, 
Uttaraphalguni and Rohini, it is 25 Dronas. In Purva- 
bhadra and Pushya, it is 15 Dronas ; in Aswini, 12 
Dronas; in Ardra, it is 13 Dronas. These quantities 
will hold good, provided the asterisms are not hurt in 
any way.

Slolcas 1-3. — I shall now try to expound briefly 
the good and bad effects arising from the Moon's con- 
junction with Rohini, having duly taken cognisance of 
them as explained by Qarga, Parasara, Kasyapa and 
Maya to their hosts of pupils and as instructed by 
Brihaspati to Narada in the park on the summit of the 
Meru, which resounds with the humming of the bees 
clinging* to the flowers of the trees in the caves of 
the golden rocks, which rings with the twitterings of 



Adh. XXIV. SI 4-5] «qft<ftsnmi 225 

numerous birds and which has the melodious strains of 
music of celestial damsels. 

Rohin i Yoga is the period of a day when the Moon passes 
through the star Rohini in the dark half of the lunar month of 
Asbadha. 

In this connection, Mr. Ohidambara Iyer, very aptly remarks : 

" These prefatory remarks clearly shew that what follow are 
important scientific truths in the eyes of Hindu astronomers : that the 
weather indications of one single day in a year should form the subject 
of so much calculation with the Hindus in determining the future 
agricultural prospect of the land while to the inexperienced eye of a 
western man of science, the day appears as indifferent or otherwise as any 
other day of the year argues that modern science is still far behind in her 
investigations of the laws of nature." 

8hka8 4-5. — An astronomer should carefully observe 
the Moon's conjunction with Rohini in the dark half 
of Ashadha and then predict its good or bad effects to 
mankind according to the tenets of the Sastras. How 
a future conjunction of the Moon with the asterism 
should be foretold has been explained by me in my work 
Panchasiddhantika under the head of '' Conjunction 
with Fixed Stars". The effects, however, must be 
declared as deduced from the Moon's size, brightness, 
colour, direction and from portents at the time and 
the winds.

unable to put up with this misery ." Hearing these 
words of Mother Earth who was choked with tears, 
whose lower lip quivered slightly, and observing her face 
hanging down with tears trickling down from her eyes, 
the Creator spoke thus: " Indra, remove this humiliation 
fek by Mother Earth; throw your thunderbolt and 
chop off the wings of the mountains." At this, Indra 
saying 'So be it ', comforted her with the word lt Don't

SloJcas 16-19. — The asterisms Abhijit, Sravana, Dha- 
nishta, Rohini, Jyeshta, Ashadha and Anuradha apper- 
tain to the circle of Indra. The following is the token : 
the clouds resembling moving mountains, sending forth 
loud peals of thunder, containing flashes of lightning and 
appearing like buffaloes' horn, swarm of bees and ser- 
pents, pour down rain. An earthquake of Indra's Circle 
will ruin men of celebrated families and castes, famous 
persons, kings and heads of corporations* It produces 
dysentery, swelling of the neck, diseases in the face and 
violent vomitting. It will also bring trouble to the peo- 
ple of Kasi, Yugangdhara, the Pauravas, Kiratas, Kiras, 
Abhisaras, Halas, Madras, Arbudas, Saurashtrians and 
Malwas. But it will give desirable rain.

Ardra, Aslesha, Moola, Uttarabhadra and Satabhishak 
constitute " Varuna's " circle whose symptoms are the 
following : huge clouds resembling blue lily, bees and 
collyrium in hue, rumbling softly, shining with streaks of 
lightning, send down slender lines of water resembling 
sharp sprouts. An earthquake of this circle will kill 
those that are dependent upon the seas and rivers ; it will 
yield excessive rain. People will forget their mutual 
hatred* It will ruin the Gonardas, the Chedis, Knkuras, 
Kiratas and the people of Videha.

Garga says ; persons in whose Nakshatras earthquakes and 
the like Utpatas occur will suffer miseries ; they shall therefore 
perform expiatory ceremonies in honor of the particular Deva under 
whose influence the occurrences take place. 

ShTca 27. — An earthquake of Indra's circle counter- 
acts one born of the Wind's period (vide slokas 3-7

Varuna's circle counteract one born of the Fire.period 
and vice versa. Thus, the earthquakes of particular 
periods and circles as stated above cancel each other. 

Garga says that if an earthquake is connected with two 
Nakshatras, division with respect to time of day takes precedence* 

Sloka £8.— During an earthquake^ of the* Fire'

Sfofa J.— An aerial city seen in the four quarters 
beginning with the north is harmful to the royal priests, 
kings, commanders of armies and the Yuvaraja respecti- 
vely. Similarly, one with white, red, yellow or dark 
colour tends to the annihilation of the Brahmins, Kshatri- 
yas, Vaisyas or Sudras as the case may be. 

8hka 2.— An aerial city seen in the north confers 
victory on the kings defending towns; in the intermediate 
quarters, it is for the destruction of persons of mixed 
castes; and one with triumphal arches in a quarter not 
facing the Sun, for the victory of kings. 

SloJca 3. — One arising in all directions and at all 
times bodes ill to the kings and countries ; and one resem- 
bfing smoke, fire and rainbow, destroys robbers and 
(Mcstefs.

the Sun), a king will die ; if to the left, it produces menace 
of enemies ; and if to the right, it confers victory. 
For tiff, refer to Adhyaya LXXXVI-12, infra. 

SZofoj 5.— When a multi-coloured aerial city, taking 
various shapes, shines in the sky with streamers, banners 
and gateways, the Earth will drink in plenty the blood of 
elephants, human beings and horses in battle. 

Thus ends the 36th Adhyaya on 'an aerial city.'

/Sftoifea I.— A mock-Sun is auspicious, if it is glossy 
and possessing the colour appropriate for the Son in the

lustre of beryl, is white or bright, it causes happiness and 
plenty. 



*S89 «^ftm«rat [XXXVII. 3, XXXVlIt. 

Sloha &<— A yellow mock-Sun produces disease ; one 
of the colour of the Asoka. blossom (red) leads to the clash 
of weapons ; and a row of mock-Suns tends to danger 
from robbers, to disease and destruction of kings,

Sloha 3. — When a mock-Sun appears to the north 
of the Sun, it gives rain ; to the south, a strong wind ; on 
both sides, danger from water ; the same appearing above 
the Sun, destroys the king ; and below, the people. 

This sloka has already appeared in the 3rd Adhyaya as Sloka 37. 
In the morning for about three hours, when there are thin 
clouds near the Sun, there appears another Sun as it were* on 
account of the Sun's rays (reflected in the clouds). This is called 
a mock-Sun. This may happen likewise in the evening also,

belonging to that particular Rasi occupied by her. Simi-

it, will deprive the King of his eyes. The King will die 
if the umbrella on the banner breaks or falls down If 
honey-bees cling to it, there will be dagger from thieves ; 
a meteor falling on it augurs the preceptor's death ; a 
lightning, that of the queen. The fall of a flag denotes 
the queen's death, while that of an ornament augurs 
drought. If the staff should break in the middle, top 
and bottom, the ministers, the King and the citizens will 
respectively meet with their end. When the staff is 
covered with smoke, there is danger from fire ; when 
with darkness, mental aberration will be the result. The 
ministers will be destroyed if the figures of the snakes 
fall or break. If portents are observed in the north and 
other quarters, Brahmins and other castes will suffer. If

ing, talks of childxen and the words of women do not fail 
of ^producing their effects. 

SloJca 98. — This Goddess of Speech is always truth-

treated, in great detail, of the good and bad effects of the 
celestial and atmospheric phenomena mostly in connec- 
tion with the planets 1 courses, conjunctions, wars, paths 
and the like. " It does not behove Varahamihira, being 
noted* for brevity, to repeat the same subject, " so 
some will find fault with him. But those in the know of 
this science should not say that this chapter is a repeti- 
tion of the effects already dealt with, because this 
chapter, entitled * Barhi Chitraka ' — Peacock's colours- 
is a well-known chief section of this Samhita (collection) 
[or " since this is an important section of the Samhita, 
men of science should not repeat the subject] and it is 
but the nature of this section to reiterate what has been 
once recounted. If I leave out this chapter, still people 
will blame me.

ling a rainboV is a "rod" (Danda) ; the long rays of the

SZofow 21-22.— The period after the Sun has half- 
set and before the stars have appeared, is called the 
evening twilight ; and that after the stars have lost their 
lustre and before the Sun has half-risen is the morning 
twilight. From the aforementioned symptoms of the 
twilights, one should predict good or bad effects #

completely routed; if the birds fly in front, he will be 
victorious.

to an aerial city screens the Sun's orb, it is to be pre- 
dicted that the King has a war of dire consequences 
in store. 

Sloka 27. — Auspicious is a twilight that is clear, 
resounding with the cries of birds and beasts, not facing 
the Sun, and having gentle breeze ; while one spoilt by 
dust, coarse or blood-like brings about the destruction of 
the country. 

Sloka 28. — Here have I expounded without any 
repetition all that the ancient sages have treated of in

The following notes of Mr. Chitambara Iyer relating to the 
phenomena of nature culled from other works are requoted : 

" There will be famine as long as the course of Jupiter and 
that of Saturn lie through the end of the signs Mesha ahd Vris* 
chika and through the middle of Vrishabha and Simha. 

During the period when Jupiter and Saturn occupy a single 
sign of the zodiac, there would be pestilence, cholera and death 
among the people. 

As long as Jupiter and Venus continue together in a state of 
disappearance, mankind will suffer from devils, diseases, thieves 
and enemies. 

If the course of Saturn or the retrograde motion of Mars 
should lie through the signs of Dhanus, Mesha, Vrishabha, l.Ieena 
or Simha, there wouid be such deaths among men and animals 
that only a third of mankind, of elephants, horses, cows and other 
animals of birds and of creatures of water would survive. 

If the motion of Mars should be an accelerated one, there 
would be fear from destructive fires ; if he should retrograde and 
enter another sign, the people would suffer from heat aud many 
families would suffer, and if his course should be through a sign 
longef than the calculated period, there would be drought in the 
land and rulers will be at war. 

If Jupiter should retrograde or if his motion should be an 
accelerated one, and if in this state he should enter another sign, 
the rivers would not be full ; the kings would lose their glory and 
suffer from diseases. : 

If Saturn should, after a lon^r direct course, begin to retro- 
grade or have an accelerated motion and in this state enter another 
sign, there would be diseases, famine and drought in the land 
and vehicles will suffer destruction. 

If, when Jupiter should enter another sign when in his acce- 
lerated motion, Saturn should be in his slow motion, Venus should 
have disappeared, and Mercury should have reappeared, the 
country would perish. 

"If Saturn, Mars and Jupiter should be within sight of eadh 
other* men with their children would suffer from hunger and f*6r& 
weapons. ^, t , ^

If, while the course of the Sun lies through 'the end of the 
signs Vrishabha, Mithuna, Vrischika and Simha, Jupiter and Mars 
should be in conjunction with it, mankind would suffer from 
famine, and the deaths would be so many that in the cremation 
grounds of villages and towns, Pisachas might be seen with 
hundreds cf dead bodies in their mouths. 

If two, three or four planets should meet together, people would 
suffer from death an.l famine. If five planets should meet, there 
would also be famine ; if six, the chief ruler would run away 
from his kingdom, and if seven, humanity would come to an end. 

If the course of Mars and Saturn, through the signs of Kar- 
kataka, Simha and Meena should be retrograde or re-retrograde, 
there would be much suffering on earth. There would also be a 
scarcity of water and wars in the land ; grains would be des- 
troyed and mankind would suffer fro m robbers. 

If Saturn and Rahu should meet, crops would be injured ; 
commodity would become scarce ; husbands and wives would be 
at strife, there would be drought and famine in the land ; cows 
would suffer death and men, would become exceedingly lazy. 

If the course of the Sun and the Moon, both of brilliant discs, 
should lie through the seven asterisms roni Kritfcika, Madhya- 
desa wou^d suffer miseries. 

If the course of the Sun, the Moon, Mars and Venus should 
lie through the seven asterisms from Magha, there would be grief 
and disease among men and the God of Death would be busy in 
his wide work of destruction in the southern countries. 

If the course of Jupiter, the Moon and Mercury, all of brilliant 
discs, should lie through the seven asterisms from Anuradha, the 
western countries, as far as the sea, as well as the western sea 
itself with its creatures would suffer miseries. 

If the course of the Sun. Venus and Mars should lie through 
the seven asterisms from Sravishta, the northern countries would 
suffer miseries. If the benefic planets should appear of the colour 
of gold, the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, the Vaisyas and the Sudras 
would all attend to their respective duties and would become 
happy."

auspicious. 

SloJca 4*. — A sword that has a breach, is too short, 
blunt, cut at the top, not appealing to the eye and the 
piind, and without resonance betokens misery ; whereas 
one with characteristics contrary to the above will yield 
good results. 

SloJca 5. — The sounding of a sword by itself fore- 
bodes the owner's death ;,its not coming out of its sheath, 
defeat : its coming out ^of the sheath by itself indicates

existence of a similar one in their private parts. 

SZo&a JO. — Noting the particular limb touched by 
a swordsman who questions a diviner about injuries in 
the sword, the latter should declare the injury to exist in 
the particular part of the sword kept in the sheath, by 
understanding the following rules thereon. 

To find out if there are dents at all on the sword, one should 
find out the Lagna at the time : if there are malefics in the 
Kendras, surely there will be som e flaw in the sword.

consideration the behaviour of thetimbs of the questioner 
with reference to himself or to another person and the 
particular time of his query. For, Time which is Om- 
niscient, All-powerful, and All-seeing, on account of its 
being the Soul (sustainer) of all beings— moveable and 
stationary — shows good and bad effects through the 
bodily movements and utterances of the querists-

the thief is to be found in his mother ; If the head, in his 
father (or teacher) ; and if the right and left arms, [in his 
brother and brother's wife respectively. Thus prediction 
of theft has to be made from the touch of the limbs.

for the non-recovery of the stolen properties: The 
querist touches an external part of the body after an 
internal one ; or spits phlegm, passes urine or evacuates 
the bowels ; or drops something from his hand ; or bends 
some limb extremely and cracks it ; or beholds empty

Sloka 35. — When an evil omen is seen or heard, it 
is to be predicted i that the man has eaten the flesh of

There are many writers on architecture such as Viswakarman* 
Maya, Kama and Hiranyagarbha. The last one mentions 64 or 
120 varieties of houses. Great kings can have mansions of 8J 
storeys ; Brahmins, of 7i ; Kshatriyas, of 6£ ; Vaisyas, of 5i ; 
and Sudras, of 3£. The height of Sudra's house ought not to 
exceed 20 moderate cubits ; that of Vaisya's, 40 cubits ; that of 
Kshatriya's, 60 cubits; that of Brahmin's, 80 cubits ; and that of 
king's, 100 cubits. The last is the maximum limit for the height 
of human habitations. 

According to the same authority, the height of the founda* 
tions of best houses is to be 2\ cubits. 

There is restriction regarding the height of th^ storeys of 
buildings with two, three and four halls* In a house of a single 
hall, the height is equal to its breadth. 

According to another authority, viz Sakra, the width of single- 
hailed houses is not restricted ; but it should not exceed the 
length. Should it. exceed the length, such houses would be called 
Utsargas. But single-hailed houses are not prescribed for Brah- 
mins, etc. Such houses are not conducive to longevity! but if 
made of straw, they can be permitted (Garga). 

Viswakarman speaks of three kinds of digits, viz, f major* 
moderate and minor. The first is the length of eight of full* 
grown barley grains ; the, second* of seven ; and the third* of six. 

I ♦ %. 65 



434 ff<ftffriwf^ [Adhi LHL 5V4243; 

Thoy are respectively called Prasaya, Sadharana. and Sama. 
It appears our author refers here to the last kind of digit. Viswa- 
karman opines that in the construction of houses, etc., the first 
kind of digit should be adopted; of beds, eating plates, vehicles, 
etc., the last variety. 

The combination of old and new bricks, baked and raw ones, 
€tc, is forbidden. But Hiranyagarbha says : if necessary, raw 
bricks should be used below, and then baked ones. Maya objects 
to this and states : — There are five things to be done for houses ; 
viz. 9 Katima, Granthima, Dayima, Ripima and Khatima. Hiranya- 
garbha says : There are different kinds of houses according to 
the materials used in the construction. One built of stone is 
called Mandira ; of baked bricks, Vastu ; this is the best ; of 
raw bricks, Sumanfca; of mud, Sudhara; pf wooden logs, Mana- 
sya; of bamboos, Nandana ; of canvas for kings, Vijaya ; of vari- 
eties of straw, Kalima. 

For house-holders the fcest houses are those made of gold, 
silver, copper and iron. They are respectively called Pushkara, 
Sribhava, Suryamanta and Chancla. There are also four other 
varieties, viz., those made of lac, Anila, tin and Varibandhaka 
fall<W^). Thus there are fourteen varieties of houses in all 
categories. 

SloJca 42. — In order to divide the ground-plan of 
a house into 81 squares, draw ten lines from east to 
west and ten others from north to south. Inside the

the outer compartments. Thus, there are 45 deities in 
this figure, (p. 436)

be predicted that on tho spot there is a bone of a mem- 
ber corresponding to the limb touched.

Slokas h3 — A white umbrella of the following des- 
cription brings all round happiness and victory to a king. 
It is to be made of the feathers of swans, cocks, peacocks 
or cranes ; it must be covered all round with a fresh, white 
silken cloth. It must be adorned with pearls and have 
garlands of pearls suspended all round from its edges ; 
its handle is made of crystal ; the rod of a single wood 
is six cubits in length, covered with pure gold and having 
seven or nine joints- The extent or diameter is 3 cubits. 
It should be well-knit all over and adorned with gems.

SloJca 1. — When a country is conquered, the most 
important thing there is only a city whereof the essen- 
tial part is a mansion , and in this the most desirable 
portion is only a room ; and even here the most beauti- 
ful thing is a couch, whereon an excellent damsel, ador- 
ned with gems and gold ornaments, is the pith and essence 
of the happiness accruing from the possession of a king- 
dom. 

This reminds one of Valmiki's statement "W^RTT^ *1W& 
tfkmm sntjprai WWL •" This chapter is on a par with Bhartri- 
hari's Sringara Sataka (j$|FK5I^) and will have great attraction 
for people of widely differing tastes as " *tct frs^sfrrcr 3§*rrafaR 
*rHPCi>wc* " Some of the statements in this chapter sound rather 
frivolous and light-hearted. The purpose is most probably to 
please the patron-sovereign of the author, who requires the plea, 
sore of the company of a sweet-heart after a strenuous career of 
wars of conquest* 



590 W^htmnrn [Adh, LX^iV, Sh frfr 

Sloka #.— Damsels beautify gems and they are not 
adc^ned by the lustre of the latter ; for they captivate 
the heart even without the aid of gems ; but the gems 
do not without their association with beautiful maidens. , 

The last quarter can be interpreted as — Whati are gem? (the 
greatest things) but union with damsels ? 

Sloka 3. — The embrace of a sweet-heart affords a 
bit (an iota) of pleasure to the kings who have to sup- 
press their feelings, who strive to vanquish the forces of 
their foes, who deeply ponder over diplomatic methods 
that are replete with the ramifications of hundreds of 
things that are done and not done, who act upon the 
advice given by their ministers, who apprehend danger 
from every quarter (suspect every body) and who are 
consequently plunged, so to say, in the ocean of misery, 

" Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown ' ; so in the midst 
of his miserable and care-worn life, the company of a sweet 
partner gives a king ab least some pleasure for some time. This 
of course for the poor soul should not be grudged by the people 
lest his life should be a burden and a liability.

bered ; for its sake are done righteous deeds and wealth 
amassed ; from that do men derive worldly pleasures and 
offspring. Such damsels are the goddesses of fortune. 
Hence they should always be honoured at home with 
respect and wealth. 

This reminds one of Manus dictum " ^ ^TT^J <j^r% w$ ^

are treated with respect.

cynical. For they do not mean what they say.

to men in respect of merits. And the following are the

there was no necessity for women to fight for equality.

In the days of Varahamihira, Suttee must have been in great

less. For the quint-essence of a kingdom consists of 
dainty food and damsels ; and all the rest is only fuel for 
kindling the fire of appetite. 

SloJca 18. — It is my firm conviction that the erotic

in the prime of youth, with swelling bosoms, and mur-

cannot be had even in the Creator's Heaven (Brahma-

and female. Why then should we feel ashamed of it, 
when even Lord Siva was forced to take four faces on 
account of his greed to have a look at a maiden ? 

The story alluded to here is that once the celestial courtezan 
Tilottama, was going round Lord Siva on whose lap was seated 
Parvati, The lord being afraid of offending Parvati created four 
faces for himself in order to look at the matchless beauty of the 
damsel.

Sloka 1. — The man who is loved by damsels en- 
joys all the sexual pleasures in the most excellent manner,

Such a soul should be comprehended by a steadfast

young women mentally go only to their beloved ones. 

Sloka 5. — Favourableness or courtesy is th< safe

from Haritaka, Sankha, Ghana, Rasa, Valaka, Jaggery,

The words in the 3rd quarter have to be construed thus : the 
succeeding constituents should be 1th in excess of the preceding 
one, the first one being ith and the last S. qjT here is interpreted 
as a part in general and not as a quarter* By the usage of the 
word * many \ it is evident that the 9 constituents may be mixed 
in any order, taking care to see that no two are mixed in the 
same proportion. For example, by mixing one part of Hareetaka 
two parts of Sankha, three of Ghana, etc., the other constituents 
being increased in this order, one kind of perfume is formed. 
Since it is not necessary that the order of the constituents should 
be the same, /£ or 362880 perfumes can be prepared.

The numbers 1, 2, 3 16 in the first 

column represent respectively the 16 sub- 
stances mentioned in slokas lf3-14, supra 
(pp. 606-607). Firstly, let the first 3 sub- 
stances be considered as constant and any 
one of the remaining as variable. The num- 
ber of perfumes formed will be 13. Next* 
taking substances 1, 3, and 4 as constant and 
one of the rest as variable, we get 12 varie- 
ties. Proceeding further in the same man- 
ner, we get 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 
varieties, or 91 in all- 

Now let the substances 1, 2 and 4 be 
considered as constants and one of the re- 
maining as variable, we get 12 perfumes. 
By taking 1, 3 and 5 as constants, the num- 
ber will be 11, and so on. The total will thus be 78. 

Similarly making 1, 2, 5 ; 1, 3, 6; 1, 4, 7 etc., as constants, 
we shall get 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. 3, 2, 1 or a total of 66 
varieties. 

Thus we shall get 91, 78, 66, 55, 45, 36, 28, 21, 15, 10, 6, 3, 
1 or 455 in all. Proceeding in the same way with other combina- 
tions, the several totals will be 364, 286, 220, 165, 120, 84, 56, 35, 
20, 10*4, 1 or a grand total of 1820-

in the middle, she will be devoid of bash fulness, and on 
the close* bashfully drop her face- Then again she will 
show, during coitus, various graceful expressions of senti- 
ment, and perceiving the disposition of her lover atten- 
tively adapt herself to him in movements indicative of 
weariness or otherwise as the case may be.

so too is one of Deodar or Asana with Sriparna. Sal 
and Saka on the one hand and Haridraka and Kadamba 
on the other, are good, whether used jointly or separately.. 
A cot wholly made of Spandana or Amba tree is not aus- 
picious, since it destroys life ; one of Asana coupled with 
other timber produces'* immediately various troubles. 
It is beneficial to have the legs of Spandana tree for 
couches made of Amba, Spandana and Chandana. 
Couches and seats made of any fruit-tree will have 
favourable effect.

Sloka 26. — A cut that is white, even, fine-smelling,

the trees used for couches. 

Sloka 27. — In fitting up the frame of the couch, 
the ttpsjpf the beams should be laid in a direction from 
left to right ; so say the ancient seers. If they be laid 
contrariwise, or all turned to one direction, there would 
be danger from devils. 

f«CI is the frame consisting of two short beams, one on the 
headside, and the other on the footside, and two others on the 
two sides. The side beams are fixed into the two other smaller 
beams. In doing so take the head side where the foot of the beam 
faces north and tip, the south, the foot of ths southern beam should 
l?c &$pd into the tip of the first beam, and so on, This is called 
SftRjpWJf. The tips of both the beams should not be put together. 

Sloka 28. — If one of the legs is put topsy-turvy, the

SloJcas 29-31. — If there is a hollow or a discoloured 
knot in the upper part of the leg, the owner will have 
cerebral disease. If there is such a knot in its pot, he 
will have stomach trouble ; if in the shank-like part be- 
low the pot, danger to his shanks ; if in the support be- 
neath that, loss of wealth ; if in the hoof, trouble to the 
hoofed animals. Inauspicfous also is a knot occurring at 
a third of the length of the side-beams and cross-beams.

in the wood may be summed up in the following list : — 
Nishkuta (cavity), Kolaksha (boar's eye), Sukaranayana

Slokas 33-35* — The blemish called Nishkuta (cavity) 
is like a pot, hollow in the middle and narrow at the 
mouth ; the second, Kolaksha is blue and like a grain of 
black gram ; the third, Sukaranayana, is uneven, dis- 
coloured and extending over one joint and a half ; the 
fourth — Vatsanabha — is a spot running from left to right, 
broken and extending over one joint; the fifth, Kalaka, 
is a black spot ; and the sixth (!*§^) is also dark, but cut. 
A faulty spot having the same colour as the »wood itself 
is not deemed so harmful.

Slokas 36-37.— The blemish going by the name of 
Nishkuta causes loss of wealth ; Kolaksha, ruin of the 
family ; Sukara, danger from weapons ; Vatsanabha, 
danger from disease. The last two blemishes and a spot 
bored by insects are not auspicious. In general, timber 
full of knots is never good.

wealth and foremost; renown. One made from five kinds

horses, women and so on, on account of the excellence 
of their intrinsic merits ; but here are dealt with precious 
stones* such as diamonds.

Shka 14r- A diamond is said to be beneficial to the 
owner ; it cannot be pierced by any other substance, is 
light, cleaves through water like a ray, is glossy and 
similar to lightning, fire or the rain-bow. 

The commentator interprets u 3F«ri& 3TC1% dwre*'' as sinks in 
water and is full of rays : but <TCl% generally means ' floats.' 

Shka 15.— Diamonds that show scratches like crow- 
feet, bees or hair, are mixed with coloured mineral sub- 
stances or gravel, have double facets, are burnt, dis- 
coloured, lustreless or perforated, are inauspicious. 

Sloka Jft — So also are those that are covered with 
bubbles, split at the points, flattened, or oblong like the 
Vasi fruit. The price of all such is one-eighth less than 
that above specified. 

Shka 17. — Some authorities opine that women 
wishing Jto beget sons should never wear diamonds ; but 
(in our opinion) diamonds that are triangular, trigonal 
and like the coriander seed, or the buttocks, are product- 
ive of good results to ladies desiring male offspring* 



63a Hwforrerci [Ad h. LXXXl. SU14. 

Btoka 18. — A diamond with inauspicious characte- 
ristics causes the ruin of the wearer's kith and kin, wealth 
and fife ; whereas a good one destroys the enemies and 
danger from thunderbolt and poison ; it increases, the 
of kings as well.

of Omens, having read the works of Rishabha who incor- 
porated in his work the teachings of Indra, Sukra, Briha- 
apati, Sage Kapisthala and Garuda, of Bhaguru of 
Devala, of the blessed king Dravyavardhana, ruler of

Sloha 5.— During a man's journey, an omen reveals 
the fruition of his deeds? good and bad, done in a pre- 
vious birth. 

This shows that the omens are not superstitious beliefs. They 
indicate one's belief in the rebirth of the soul and thus reveal 
effects of past deeds, good or bad. 

SloJca 6 — Omens are of various kinds, as those 
through beings that are rural, wild, aquatic, terrestrial, 
heavenly, diurnal, nocturnal and diurnal-nocturnal. The 
sex of the creatures is to be determined from their cry, 
gait, look and speech. 

Rural beings are men, horses, elephants and dogs ; wild

to the Commentator when there is a doubt as to whether la fcertaia

sex of a person talking near by*

their sex owing to the multiplicity of their genera arid the

absence of a fixed habitat, Sage Garga, the senior, has 
written the following two verses explaining their general 
characteristics. 

Slokas 8-0. — "The male creatures have fleshy, high 
and large shoulders, broad necks, a fine breast, small but 
deep sound and great valour (or firm gait ?) ; whereas the 
female ones have slender breast, head and neck, small 
face and feet, little courage and harmonious and melodi- 
ous voice. Those that are possessed of characteristics 
different from these are eunuchs.' ' 

Eunuch will have masculine as well as feminine characte- 
ristics combined in them. 

Sloka 10. — The creatures that live in villages, fo- 
rests, etc., are to be understood only from conventional 
knowledge. Here I should like to delineate • in brief 
only those that are relevant to journeys. 

srft srr m*v mm\%fam$\sfaw{ hUii 

Sloka 11. — A man going on a journey ought to con- 
sider the omens, good or bad, as relating to his own 
person ; in a marching* army, they relate to the sove- 
reign ; in a city, to the tutelary deity (or to the Mayor) ; 
jp an assembly, to the chieftain. When there are many 



648 treSffrmmi [Adk LXXXVL SI 12/ 

chieftains of the same rank in a concourse, they refer to 
one who is seniormost,' by virtue of his birth, learning 
and age. 

Sloka IS. — For three hours after Sunrise the North- 
east is called Mukta Surya (i. e. } one that has aban- 
doned the Sun), the East, Prapta-Surya {i.e , one that 
has attained the Sun) and the South-east, Eshyat Surya 
(one that is going to get the Sun) ; for the second watch 
of the day, the East, South-east and South respectively 
get those names ; for the third watch, the South-east, 
South, and South-west ; for the fourth watch, South, South- 
west and West ; for the first watch of the night, South- 
west, West and North-west ; for the 2nd watch, West, 
North-west and North ; for the third watch, North-west f 
North and North-east ; and for the fourth watch, North, 
North-east and East The effects of omens in the res- 
pective directions are as signified by their names given 
above, i. e., in the Mukta- Surya quarter, the effect of the 
omen is already spent up ; in the next quarter, it is to be 
experienced the same day ; and in the next, it is impend- 
ing. The three quarters named above, viz. Mukta, Prapta 
and Eshya (abondoned, prevailing and coming) are 
severally termed Angara (charcoal), Deepta (burning) and 
Dhumini (smoking), and the remaining quarters, tranquiL 

The commentator refutes the statement of some scholars who 
hold that the East is smR£$ or afw during the three hours made 
up of the last half watch of the night and the first half -watch at 
the day, and quotes Garga in support of his contention, • 

N. Br- In the light of this view, we^ have to make some 



Adh. LXXX VI, SI 13Q ^i^fimits^mt 643 

addtions in some previous chapters. We have to refer to this Sloka 
while commenting upon the term sflH occurring previously. 

Sloka 13 — Omens occurring in the 5th directions 
from these three — Charcoal, Burning and Smoking-augur 
well equally for the past, present and future. The good 
or bad effects of omens occurring in the remaining two 
quarters will have to be judged from their proximity to 
the particular Tranquil quarter. 

To make this cleat* : — It has been already stated that 3 quar- 
ters at a time get the appellations of Charcoal, Burning and Smok- 
ing and that the remaining 5, of Tranquil. Here the author speaks 
of the 5th quarter counted from any one of these three. If we 
take the first triad N. E., E and S. E. (Charcoal, Burning and 
Smoking) we get as the 5th ones to these : S. W., W and N. W, 
respectively. Similarly in the case of other triads. So of these 
5 Tranquil quarters, only one is very beneficial to the particular 
member of the triad ; /\ #., a good omen in the 5th quarter from 
* Charcoal ' indicates some good thing that has already occurred ; 
from the 'Burning', a good thing that takes place the same day; 
and from the * Smoking * a good thing that is going to take place 
in the near future. Similarly a bad omen in these indicates only 
very slight harm. Suppose an omen takes place not in the 5th 
quarter from any member of the triad, but one place this side or 
that; then we will have to see to which of the Tranquil quarters 
it is proximate and then predict the results; e. g.> let us take the 
" Burning * direction. Suppose an evil omen occurs not in the 5th 
from this, but near the 5th from 'Charcoal'; then the bad 
effect which had been already felt was slight ; similarly, if a good 
omen takes place, there was some good effect : but if there is a 
good omen near the 5th flom, * Smoking \ the evil effect in the 
'future will be moderate ; if it is a bad one, the same in the future 
will be very great,

Sloka 14. — Omens occurring near by and at a lower 
level bear fruit (good or bad) immediately ; whereas those 
far off and at a higher place, in distant future. Moreover 
the predictions will have to be made suitably after a 
consideration of the growing or diminishing nature of the 
place on which the omen is perched. 

Suppose a bad omen ><-• ^-een on a growing thing (say, a tree); 
then the malefic effect will not he exce-^ive; similarly, if there is 
a good one there, the bereft,. ml tfieU will be very ureat and in- 
creasing gradually. Suppose there i- a bad omen in a dying tree; 
the bad effects will be extreme ; so also a good one there will pro-,

Slohas 15. — An omen is said to be blasted by a 
divine agency when it occurs in a malefic Muhurta, lunar 
day and lunar mansion, when the wind blows foul and 
the Sun is in opposition ; whereas it is blasted by action, 
when it has untoward gait, position, disposition, 
sound and movements of limbs. In both the sets, the 
power of each element is greater than its predecessor. 

In the Muhurtas of dreadful and cruel asterisms an omen is 
'blasted'; so too in the 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th and 14th lunar days ; in the 
Btars Mula, Jyeshta, Aslesha, Ardra ,Bharani, VisaJkha f Maghay 
Erittika and Purvapbalguni (and other Parvas); during the wind 
which is fierce, rough, strong and unfavourable; in a direction op* 
posite the Sun, and in one where there 41 is such a wind as given 
above. Thus there are five varieties of Blasting an omen through 
a divine agency. There are live other varieties called 'Blading of

wind, it is Blasted by 'Gait ;' when it is stationed in a cuti broken, 
crooked, smeared Tifa^WT, dilapidated or withered, or dirty 
support, ifc is, by 'position;' an omen in the form of a lifeless or 
unconscious or partially conscious creature, is blasted in 'feelings 
or life'; when it utters a word whose letters are ill-pronounced and 
lengthened* the voice being feeble and broken, it is called 'blasted 
in voice' : when a bird flaps its wings, shakes its beak, is about to 
fall down, cries hoarse and pecks at trees, it is 'blasted by move- 
ment/ (The commentator quotes Rishiputra who in his turn 
quotes Lord Indra).

Slokeb 16 — In the same manner there are ten varie- 
ties of omens that are ' Tranquil'. One eating grass and 
fruits is a 'Tranquil' or beneftc omen, while one eating 
meat and ordure is 'blasted' (malefic). One eating cooked 
food is supposed to be of a mixed kind, i. e. "Tranquil 
cum blasted/' 

SloJca 17. — Most excellent are the omens that are 
situated in mansions, temples (or palaces), auspicious 
abodes (such as are occupied by Gods, Brahmins and 
cows), and places that please the heart (by cool shade 
and fine carpet of grass), as well as those perched on 
trees that are laden with sweet fruits, that are milky, 
that have flowers and fruits.

Sloka 69.— If an omen be strong and accompa- 
nied by some substance, there wou?d( be the arrival of a 
person with sometjiing in his band. If the omen be 



Adh. LXXXVt. SI. 70-7 2.] ^wftfiwwww: 663 

lustrous and looking down, though auspicious, the person 
arriving would be a perpetrator of heinous crimes. 

Another meaning for the 2nd half :— If the omen be lustrous, 
the person arriving would be one of a peaceful temperament ; if 
it looks down, he will be a doer of heinous critnes. 

Sloka 70. — If the cry of an omen stationed in a 
1 Burning * corner be followed by another to its left, it 
indicates a man*s marital alliance with a woman of the 
type indicated by that direction. 

This idea may be stretched to the case of a woman also. 

Sloka 71. — The cry of an omen standing in a 'Tran- 
quil f quarter being followed by another stationed in a 
1 Burning ' one that is fifth from the ' Tranquil ' quarter, 
bestows victory, or indicates the arrival of the person 
assigned to that quarter. If it be otherwise, (one cry in 
a ' burning ' quarter followed by another in a c tranquil ' 
quarter fifth from it), troubles will arise. 

Another meaning is possible —An omen standing in a ' tran- 
quilt ' quarter and crying along with another in another ' tranquil * 
quarter which happens to be the fifth from the ' Burning • 
quartefat the time, etc. In this case <tIot^ is to be interpreted 
as afar: SH^q^rM— one staying in a * Iteming ' quarter crying 
with another in another quarter which is fifth from one of the 
4 Tianquii ' quarters. 

Sloka 72.— An omen standing between two others 
to its left and rigfct with its cry being reciprocated by 



6e6 twtfenm* [Adh. LXXXVl. SI, 73*75, 

them indicates severally peril to a person from his own 
kith and kin and foes. (If both the flanking omens cry 
aher it, then there will be trouble for both the quarters,) 
All the three crying simultaneously portend death. 

Shka 73. — An omen standing at the top, middle 
or foot of a tree, indicates severally the arrival of a per* 
son riding an elephant, horse or chariot ; one standing on 
a long substance, a lotus or the like of it or something 
whose top is chopped off, indicates severally the arrival 
of a man carried by another man, by a ship or by a 
sedan chair. 

Shka 74*.— An omen situated on a lofty height 
(such as a mountain) indicates the arrival of a person in 
a cart ; one in the shadow, of a person holding an um- 
brella- Whatever good or bad consequences are indi- 
cated by the omens situated in the four quarters, East 
etc. or in the other corners, South-east, etc., will come to 
be felt in order in one, three, five and seven days.

Sloka 75. — The lords of the eight quarters, East, 
South-east, South, South-west, West, North-west, North,

Niiriti (King of evil Spirits), Va^una, Vayu, the Moon 
and Siva- The four prime quarters are masculine, while * 
the corners, feminine.

This knowledge helps one to find out the name (synonym of 
Indra, etc.) of the person that has arrived or is going to arrive ; 
or his tutelary deity. In queries regarding theft or the missing 
of an article, fche omen gooi or bid indicates the direction of 
thief and article, possibility of recovery, etc The worship of 
the particular deifcy will allay fche fears of a person who has seen 
a bad omen in that direction. Similarly the sex can be found 
out in the above cases.

m wife mr* [Adh. LXXXV1. SI. 77*78* 

part?, if there be an omen in the eight directions be- 
ginning with the East, the respective materials on which 
writing may exist are a tree, palm-leaf, a worthless frag* 
ment of leaf, cloth, water-product (lotus-leaf), reed, lea- 
ther and silk. The effects of the omens will be felt in 
the respective divisions. 

SloJca 77*— If omens are found in the eight quarters, 
their effects will be felt severally near a place of military 
exercise, near a fire-place, where some sound is heard, 
where a quarrel takes place, near water, where fetters 
and the like are kept> where Veda is chanted and where 
the bellowing of cows is heard. The colours of things that 
may be found as a result of omens in the prime quarters 
beginning with the East are in order, red, yellow, black 
and white ; but in the corners, they are mixed. 

In the 8. B., it is yellowish red; in S. W., dark-yellow; in 
N. W., grey and in N. E. f pale-red. The use of this is— -suppose 
an omen has some substance with it; the person will get some 
pbject of the colour assigned to the particular quarter. This 
knowledge may be made use of in cases of theft and missing 
articles, or colours of cloths, or devotion to deities presiding over 
the colours. 

Bloka 78. — The signs of the eight quarters begin- 
ning with the East are: a banner, something burnt, a 
burial ground, a cave, water, a mountain, a sacrifice and 
a hamlet of cow.herds (or proclamation ?). Good or bad 
«meris stationed on these signs augur a meeting* with 



Adh. LXXXVI. SI. 79-80.1 *3frftams«wf: 6tf& 

some good person or danger respectively. Other things 
viz., good or bad doings (presaged by omens) take place 
in auspicious or inauspicious quarters. 

SZofta 79. — When the question refers to women,,, 
omens appearing in the several quarters beginning with j 
the East point to a buxom woman, a virgin, a woman of, 
defective limbs, one that is stinking, one of blue-saree 
a wicked woman, a tall one, and a widow respectively.., 
These are useful in questions pertaining to meetings. 

There is another interpretation, since women are assigned to 
the corners. The four corners N. E. t S. E. t S. W. f "and N. W., 
indicate severally a buxom virgin, a crippled and a stinking 
woman a wicked woman of blue cloth and a tall widow. 

Sloha 80* — When at a query the querist or an omen 
stands in any of the eight quarters, the question refers 
severally to silver, gold, a sick person, a charming dam- 
sel, a goat or sheep, a vehicle (or journey), a sacrifice or 
a cow-shed* Similarly the trees corresponding to these 
quarters are in order, the banyan, a red tree f Lodhra, 
bambojj^mango, Khadira, BiKva and Arjuna. 

When there is a good omen in the above quarters, one may 
get the articles belonging to them; otherwise, one will lose them. 
It refers to loss or theft of the several articles, 

irThe latter half gives us a clue as to which tree will flourish 
in each, of the quarters.

comes under his sway.

is not beneficial ; elsewhere it is favourable. Flaming 
all over the body of horses leads to loss ; so do sparks 
or smoke on their body, for two years continuously.

Sloka 2. — The flame appearing in a horse's penis 
causes the ruin of the King's harem ; in the stomach, 
of his treasure ; in the anus and the tail, leads to the 
King's defeat; in the face and head, to victory. 

Sicha 3.— The flaming of a horse's shoulders, back 
ot sides of the ne*k leads to the owner's victory ; the

flaming of the hind legs, to his imprisonment ; smoke in 
its forehead, breast, eyes or fore-legs, to defeat, while 
flame in the above limbs leads to victory. 

Sloka 4 — The flaming at night of the snout, middle 
of the nose, head, the lower part of the cheeks and eyes 
of horses that are green, coppor-hued, dark or variegated 
confers success ; it is always (both by day and night) 
auspicious with those that are white or have the hue of 
parrots. 

SioJca 5* — Antipathy to grass and water, falling 
down, sweating, convulsion without any cause, falling 
of blood from or appearing of smoke in the mouth, keep- 
ing vigil at night through hatred (or quarrel), drowsiness 
and pensive mood by day, languor and down-cast face — 
none of these activities of horses is said to be favourable. 

SloJcafi. — If a horse carrying a saddle and a rider 
gets upon another horse, or if the royal horse that is 
quite fit meets with some disaster, there will be misery.

neighs there is a full pot (one filled with auspicious sub- 
stances), curds, a Brahmin, a deity, perfumes, flowers, 
fruits, gold, etc. or some other desirable article, there 
will be victory. 

SloJca 9. — Horses that willingly take to their fodder, 
drink ancj bit or other accoutrements, or cast glances at 
their right side, bestow all desired objects on their 
masters. 

SloJca 10. — If horses stamp the earth with their left 
hoofs, their master will go abroad ; if they neigh facing

midday or midnight), he will suffer imprisonment or 
defeat.

SloJca 11* — If they neigh too much (too frequently), 
shake their tails or are sleepy, their master will go on a

or eat the dust of the earth, they indicate danger to 
their master*

SloJca 12. — If horses lie on their right side like a 
box or stand on the ground with their right leg raised, 
there will be success. The same effects as given above 
will have to be applied by a wise man to other vehicles 
(animals such as elephants and camels) as well according 
to the circumstances, 

Sloha 13. — The horse that is very subservient, when 
the king mounts it, goes in the direction to which the 
king is bound (or follows the party of sojourners)? and 
reciprocates when others neigh, or touches its right side 
with its mouth, enhances erelong its master's wealth. 

SloJca 14.— The horse that passes urine and dung 
too frequently, does not go along the proper direction 
though beaten, shows fright without any cause, and has 
tears in its eyes, does not indicate prosperity to its master,

a height that is equal to twice its girth at the root (or 
leave off a length equal to twice the circumference of 
the elephanf s tusk at the root and cut off the rest) ; but 
in the case of elephants roaming about marshy places

in a short time, in some time (within a month), and 
after a long time (after a month), respectively.

Sloka 9. — The effects of the right tusk breaking in 
these parts are severally the fleeing of the King, the 
population and the army ; of the left tusk, the destruc- 
tion of the prince royal, preceptor and the mahout ; so 
also of the army of mountaineers, the consort and leading 
personages (commanders) respectively. 

Sloka 10.— It both the tusks are found to break; 
the wholesale ruin of the royal family is to be predicted ; 
but if the breaking occurs in a benefic Lagna (Taurus, 
Gemini, Cancer, Virgo, Libra, Sagittarius, Pisces), lunar 
day, asterism and the like, there will be an increase 
of prosperity; otherwise, there will be an increase 
of misery.

the destruction of the enfcmy is assured ; otherwise (against 
thorny trees, etc.) or at the breaking of the right tusk, 
there will be prosperity to the enemy. 

Sloha 22. — If the elephant has a stumbling gait, if 
its ears stop beating suddenly, if it appears very dejected, 
if it breathes soft and long, placing its trunk on the earth, 
if its eys are full of tears or closed, if it is always sleepy, 
if it behaves in a refractory manner, if it eats something 
unwholesome, or if it passes blood (ichor ?) and dung too 
frequently, it forebodes danger, 

Sloha 13. — If the elephant breaks wantonly ant-hills 
trunks of trees, bushes, green grass or trees, if it 
looks jolly, if it goes in the direction of the march, with 
quick steps, holding aloft its face, if at the time of its be- 
ing accoutred it ejects spray or trumpets repeatedly, or if 
it gets intoxicated at the time, or if it takes its trunk 
around the right tusk, it confers victory,

a Dasa in a beneficial manner, accomplishment of the 
objects without obstacles; preservation of the hereditary 
kingdom (or wealth), getting allies, easy subjugation of 
unyielding enemies, and enjoying sound health, to a 
sovereign who has faith in them.

Sloka 62 — According to some authorities, the cries 
of omens heard after one has gone a Kros (about 2 
miles) have no effect at all. But if the first omen is 
harmful, the king should do eleven Pranayamas ; if the 
second too proves evil, he should do 16 Pranayamas, 
and if the third too persists in being malefic, he should 
return home.

Sfoha 1. — One conversant with the cries of birds 
and beasts ought to declare the effects of omens only 
after understanding the relative strength of the particular 
quarter, place, movements, sound, the particular week- 
day, asterism, Muhurta, Hora, Karana, the Ascendant, 
its divisions and its being a moveable, fixed or dual sign. 



Adh. XCVL SI. .3-5/1 "wwftwftsiwr: 725 

SloJca 2. — In the case of persons who do not pro- 
ceed on a journey, there are two kinds of the effects of 
omens, viz*, the unstable (future) and the stable. To 
the first category belong those pointing to the king, 
envoy, spy, foreign countries, attack (troubles) and kins- 
men. 

(The commentator says stable means past ones and unstable 
future)* 

Slclca 3. — The effect of omens referring to im- 
prisonment, masting (acquisition), meals, thieves, fire, 
rain, festivities, sons, death, quarrels and fears belong to 
the * stable ' category, provided the Ascendant and the 
sign occupied by the Moon at the time are fixed 
signs ; if they are moveable ones, they belong to the 
1 unstable ' category.

SloJca i. — The effects are called ; stable ', when the 
omens occur in a firm place* on a stone, in a house, a 
temple, on the earth and near water ; and when they 
are in moving things, etc, they are called ' unstable ' or

in a watery Muhurta (having the name of water or pre- 
sided over by Varuna), in a quarter presided over by 
Varuna, and in a place where there is water, that occur 
at the end of the fortnights, that are ' blasted * (by Gods 
or by action), and that cry, produce rain. Under the 
same circumstances, even a c Tranquil ' omen that is 
aquatic causes rain. 

SloJca 6. — An omen blasted by the Sun and posited 
in the S. E. corner in a fiery Ascendant (Aries, Leo, 
Scorpio, Capricorn or Aquarius), in a fiery Muhurta, in 
the Krittika asterism, and in a place where fire is kept, 
causes danger from fire, while crying ; similarly one 
occurring in Vishti Karana, in a star presided over by 
Yama (Bharani), in a sign of Saturn happening to be 
the Ascendant and in thorny trees, and on creepers 
without leaves, causes harm. 

Sloka 7. — A rural bird or beast that is ' blasted ' 
by voice or action, that is crying fiercely > that is stand- 
ing on a thorny tree in S. W., in a Lagna owned by 
Mars, and facing a person, leads to quarrel when seen.

hung down, standing in a corner and in a Navamsa of

the Ascendant or its Navamsa is owned by Sun or when 
the Sun himself is in the Ascendant, the arrival of an 
eminent personage is indicated. 

Sloka XT. — At the commencement of any work, 
count the distance in signs from the one occupied by the 
Sun to the Lagna in ths manner of ' Weal * and f Woe '

predicted.

SloJcas 12-13. — If the Sun is posited in the 12th 
place from the Lagna at the time, the person whom one 
will meet will be blind of the right eye ; if the Moon be 
there, he will be blind of the left eye ; if the Sun be in 
the Lagna itself and be aspected by malefics, he will be 
completely blind. If the Sun in the above condition be 
in his own Rasi, he will be htinch-backed, deaf or an 
imbecile. If the 6th house from the Lagna be occupied 
and aspected by malefics, the person will have ulcer in 
the limb indicated by that sign. In this- way, whatever 
marks or forms (colours) have been expounded by me 
in connection with the time of births ,will have to be 
adopted here too. 

This shows clearly that Brihatjataka was written first and 
then only this book.

their respective classes of sounds will have to be gathered from 
the Navamsasof the signs signifying the Lagna, the 4th, the 7th. 
and the 10th houses* 

3. The guttural, palatal, lingual, dental and labial class of 
cousonuuts belong severally to Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter and 
Saturn ; the eight leUess beginning with *T-ya belong to the Moon

4. The number of letters constituting a name is to be de- 
daced from tbe decanate that is rising. In an odd sign, the 
numbers will be three, five and seven respectively, in t»e first, 
second and third decanates ; and in an even sign, they will in 
order be 2, 4 and 6. They are also ascertained from the strength 
of the aspect of planets. 

5. If the Vargottama Navamsa of a iRasi be signified by an 
even and a moveable one, the name consists of two syllables ; if 
by an even and at the same time a fixed sign, four syllables* If the 
Vargottama Navamsa be an odd as well as a moveable Rasi, 
there will be three letters; if by a fixed sign, five. If the Lagna 
be a dual sign, the name will consist of as many letters as corres- 
pond to the number .signified by the Rasi (when counted^ from 

Mesha), 



730 fpwftaw* [Adh. XCVI. Si: 12-1& 

6. In the case of a dual sign, two names will have to be 
declared; when it is aspected by benefics, then too, the same 
result. The particular Navamsa rising at the time, gives the 
number of letters constituting the name. 






7. If the rising sign be odd, the name will begin with a 
conjunct consonant ; if an even one, with a letter followed by a 
conjunct consonant. When the planet (contributing a letter to 
the name) is posited in his highest exaltation, the letter is repeated 
according to the nature of the particular sign (odd or even) ; a 
name will have a long syllable 3? in the particular place signified 
by the Navamsa rising at the time. 

«ft^, §fk, WC are the examples for the first. W, *ro, ^gers, 
etc. for the second ; if odd. %<z, 3W3T, if even, %*&«C, WTC etc. 

8. When the 5th or the 9th house is occupied by planeto, 
there will be an extra syllabic instant in the name in the letter 
signified by the decanate. When the 10th house is strong, there 
will be the upper sign of long syllable; when the 4th, lower sign ; 
when the 7th, a Visarga. 

9. When a Seershodaya Rasi is risingt the mm (syllable 
instant) will be upward*; when it is a Prishtodaya one f the 
mm will be downwards* In the case of 4 dual sign rising, it is 
across ;^when it is a long sign, there is a long syllable ; when 
it is medium or short, it will be short*

10. The letters of a name are contributed by the Navamsas 
of the signs that are the lst> 4th, 7th and 10th houses. A 
malefic posited in a Kendra house destroys a syllable, while 
in a triangular one, destroys a mm The same result will arise 
even by aspect-

as the Navamsas travelled by him ; or when he is posited in a

are weak* the syllabic instant mm as well as <the syllable caused 
by that is destroyed ; still, in its stead, the first letter of the 
particular class comes into being provided the said lord is posited 
in the Navamsa that is owned by his exaltution sign and the 
Navamsa Rasi aspected by its own lord (or, and aspected by the 
lord of that Rasi or Navamsa Rasi ?)

14. In reconstructing a name, the method to be adopted is 
the following : Take the four Kendras beginning with the first 
sign (i. e , Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) and their Navam- 
sas in regular order for the first ; then take the letters of the 
classes belonging to the respective planets owing to th^ir position

four, the letters indicated are in order 3, 3T, ^ and <fi. 

[It has been explained above that the letters are to be deduced 
from the Navamsas of the 1st, 4tb, 7th and 10th houses according 
to their being owned by the several planets. Now when Mesha 
happens to be rising, the first Navamsas of this and the other 
Kendras are respectively Mesha, Kataka, Tula and Makara. These 
are owned by Mars, the Moon, Venus and Saturn respectively. 
Since they are the first Navamsas, we have to take the first letters 
of the classes belonging to the planets, viz. *, *T» ^ and V, When 
the second Navamsas of Mesha, Kataka, etc are rising, the letters 
will be for the same reason the second letters of the respective 
classes, according to their ownership; e.g. in Mesha, the 2nd

viz*, Hasta is also bad. Among the sfisrafar (Risksha Sandhi) 
Nakshatras, viz. % 3?r#?r (Aslesha), ^qrerr(jyeshta) and \lft (Revati), 
the last is good> because it is in Jupiter's sign. 3TT3TT (Ardra) is 
a ^ (Rudra) Nakshatra of fire. Therefore the Moon, a watery 
planet in aristf (Ardra) is bad (except for fiery planets like the Sun, 
Mars, etc.). 

All Nakshatras that are bad for the Moon are in zmKlW 
(Avaroha) position for the Moon, that is, away from the exaltation. 
Again, all stars that are bad for the Moon are in the 4th, 6th and 
8th signs of the zodiac with the notable exception of awsfr (Ardra). 

The 8th sign (Vrischika) is throughout bad for the Moon. 
Similar results should be expected if the Moon is progressed to 
the 8th house as per any system. The middle of the 6th sign (viz., 
f^Tf Hasta) is bad when the Moon progresses there. The end of 
the 4th sign (^TR^T Aslesha) is similarly bad. A fiery star like 
3?T^f (Ardra) is bad for a watery planet like the Moon. The Moon 
progressing to the end of the 4th sign faz% Kataka), the middle 
of the 6th sign (*F3T Kanya) and the 8th sign (?%$ Vrisohika) in 
any horoscope is bad. 

Varahamihira has considered that the Moon is good or 
capable of giving good results in the Nakshatras ruled (according 
to ftsftxlff Vimsottari system) by 'benefics (including Nakshatras 
ruled by herself) and also the Nakshatras ruled by her friend the 
Sun. Next, the Nakshatras jruied by Mars are a little beneficial. 
The Nakshatras ruled by maiefics, though good, are not capable 
of much improvement for finance. The above analysis is with

It should further be noted that Nakshatras in the signs 
Makara and Kumbha (Saturn f s), though they are ruled by benefics 
according to the rule given above, are not capable of making the 
native generous. Because, the Nakshatras are in the houses owned 
by Saturn, a conservative, stingy planet. Cf. «Kfcn (Adata) for

Sloka £.~~ Generally, the transit of planets comes 
within the purview of our daily experience. Hence I shall 
expound its effects, O noble persons in varied metres. 
Kindly excuse my volubilily. * 

This Vfcrse is composed in the 3Ti*ri metre known as g*$RqsT. 
Here the author steps into the realm of Prosody too. Primarily, 
metres are classified under two heads., viz., % \T and *Tlffi. The for- 
mer is based upon g*>ups of three syllables called swft, while the 
latter, upon groups of four Matras or syllabic instants, wm] belongs 
to the latter class. Most of the verses in this work are in the arr^j 
metre, whose construction is as follows: — The first and third quar- 
ters must have 12 Matras each of three Ganas, the second, 18 and 
the fourth 15. In the second, there will be four Ganas and a final 
long syllable. In the 4th, the 9th Matra will be considered as a group 
byl itself. Thus in both the halves, there will be 7 groups and a 
long syllable (2 Matras). It is a rule that the odd groups ought 
not to have ^Wl (^— w ) and the sixth ought to have 5T1&T or four 
Laghus ( w w w *"). Let us take the above verse itself and see if it 
satisfies these conditions. 

JL_, ^ _J W , -i_, JL, JL, - 7 _, _.(i2+i8) 

- -, _, -_,_„,- -, ., - -, _■ (12+15). 

In addition to this, the above is g^-^q^l 3rr^T ; /. e„ the 2nd 
and 4th Ganas of the first half should necessarily be swt having a 
long syllable on either side ; the second half follows the rules of an 
ordinary arrcr. In the above example the 4th *m is not sr.

Sloka I.— Having churned the ocean of Astrology 
with the H*?* mountain of my intelligence, I have taken 
out the Moon of Science (correct knowledge) that affords 
light to the world. 

The idea ia brought out here beautifully through a metaphor. 
This means that this flfcrr contains the quint-essence of the whole 
science of Astrology-cum-Astronomy. 

mfa$\*M ^ wn*4 mmm grot 11*11 

Sloka 2 — I have not discarded the works of ancient 
seers while writing this Sastra or scientific work. Hence, 
O Ye good men ! You may by all means compare mine 
with theirs, and accept whichever you like. 

awi $ mfo gsrc: smft ?>n$rrg<ir sgi I 

SloJca 3. — Or, a good man finding some excellence 
(virtue), though slender, in an ocean of faults, proclaims 
that (virtue), while a mean-minded man does contrari- 
wise (finding a small fault in an ocean of excellences, he 
proclaims the fault alone). This is the nature of the 
good and the wicked. 

wftawi mm sR3i JRtfo iron 

Sloka 4. — The gold of poetry being heated by the 
fire of wicked men becomes purified. Hence, it should 
be shown (read) to the wicked by all means.

SZo&a 5. — Whatever point of this work gets lost or 
altqretf in the course of its circulation by the fault of 
scribes or of students receiving oral instruction from th$ 
learned, may kindly -be supplied or set right by scholars 
avoiding jealousy ; so too, whatever I have ill-done, done 
niggardly, or notrdone at all. 

-, , Sloka 6. — With my intellect rendered quite ptufe 
(clear) — [or with intelligence caused by the favour] oa 
account of salutations offered to the feet of the Sun (and 
other planets), the sages such as Vyasa and my preceptor 
(i, e , my own father w^snr*?), [ have only summarised 
(or given the essence ot) this science. Hence I make 
Obeisance to the ancient authors.
